            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A SPIRITUAL RETREAT FOR ONE DAY IN EVERY MONTH. By a Prieſt of the Society of Jeſus, <hi>Tranſlated out of French,</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of publishing this Book is to furnish all ſorts of Chriſtians with an eaſy method of Retreat; eſpecially ſuch whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not afford them lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for an Annual Retreat of eight or ten Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It is hoped that the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of making theſe Retreats will render them more uſual; and ther fore for the help of thoſe who (being wholly ſtrangers to theſe pious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes) ſtand in need of more particular directions, you will find ſome Chapters in the beginning of the Book and before the Meditations, of
<pb facs="tcp:50233:3"/>the neceſſity of Retreat, and of the methods of doing it well.</p>
            <p>The Body and principal part of the Book conſiſts of meditations on the great Truths of our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; In which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to chooſe the moſt proper ſubjects, and to put them in ſuch an order and treat them ſo at large, as may render them moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on thoſe who atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and ſeriouſly conſider them. And becauſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in theſe Retreats ought to be to prepare our ſelves by a true change of Life for an happy Death, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Meditation of Death every month, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve added a new exerciſe of
<pb facs="tcp:50233:3"/>Preparation for it: which may be very uſeful if we put it in practiſe with ſuch diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as it requires: And to render it more eaſy I have been very particular in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Sentiments we ought to entertain, and in inſerting the moſt ſuitable Prayers to inſpire thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>
            <p>The laſt Part contains <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reflections</hi> upon different ſubjects, to ſupply the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of thoſe Conſiderations whic are propoſed in other Books of Spiritual Retreat, for private Reading and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. In the number &amp; variety of which Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions every Reader will find ſome thing profitable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſtate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of ſpiritual Retreat.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF all pious Exerciſes there is none more proper to convert a ſoul then a <hi>ſpiritual Retreat:</hi> And it is perhaps the onely one that is never unprofitable. When every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes either to pervert or diſtract us it is not at all ſtrange that the moſt awakening Doctrines of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion make but a light impreſſion: But when we retire our ſelves from the noiſe and diſturbance of the world, when we ſet our ſelves to meditate at leiſure on thoſe great Truths which we had never ſeriouſly enough conſidered, &amp; which appear to us then in another manner, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50233:8"/>our application enables us to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the true ſence of them, and every thing helps to diſcover all their conſequences, it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us not to be affected with them: Eſpecially ſince this is a a Time wherein grace flows more abundantly, and wherein our hearts are beſt diſpos'd to receive it.</p>
               <p>The experience of the miraculous converſion of ſo many hardned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of the eſtablishment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſo many Religious Houſes; of ſo many lukewarm Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians recoverd from their tepidity and become in a few Days fervent ſervants of God; is a ſenſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the benefit wee may reap by conſidering in order and in ſolitude the great Truths of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Xaverius, S. Charles Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus, S. Françis de Sales,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſaints of theſe latter ages, have acknowledg'd that they owe their converſion and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in holineſs to theſe ſpiritual Exerciſes. And 'tis in imitation of theſe Examples that they who apply
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50233:8"/>themſelves ſeriouſly to work out their ſalvation, and all well regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Community's, put themſelves under an indiſpenſable obligation to conſecrate yearly at leaſt eight or ten Days to the ſame Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Let us not flatter our ſelves, tis very hard to keep our affections pure in the midſt of a world where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing conſpires to defile them; We shall find it very difficult to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve long among ſo much corruption and not be ſome way tainted with it. Time ſlackens the greateſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and the moſt heroick virtue ſtands in need of frequent ſupply's of ſtrength: To which end it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to retire our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves from time to time, and if we would breath a purer air we muſt ſeek it in ſolitude.</p>
               <p>As too much worldly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alway's diſtracts, abates our fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and makes all out virtues languishing and weak: ſo it is only by recollection and retreat that we can recover our ſelves and regain new fervour.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt deſcended viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50233:9"/>only in the Deſart,
<note place="margin">Quamdiu in exterioti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus fui, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem tuam audire non potui nunc autem rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ad me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus ſum ad te ut poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim ad te au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire &amp; tibi loqui. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere ergo miſericordiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime quia au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſervus tuus; loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quia para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire. <hi>S. Bern. de inter. dom. cap.</hi> 66.</note> and when the Apoſtles were in Retreat, &amp; S. Bernard declares that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear the voice of God while he was taken up with worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but as ſoon as he came to himſelfe he retir'd into ſolitude to converſe at leiſure with his Divine Maſter, and to ſay with confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſpeak now my God for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant heareth, ſpeak for Jam ready to obey thy will.</p>
               <p>Can any man reaſonably refuſe to practiſe what is ſo much for his advantage, and what he ſtands ſo much in need of? Yet many who are convinc'd of the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, pretend that they have not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for it; and this is the common excuſe of thoſe who neglect it. But Good God! will this excuſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Our buſineſs takes up all our time, is not the care of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation a buſineſs? Can any thing in the world be of ſo great importance to us or concern us ſo nearly? Alas! we have indeed no other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs but this; we were ſent into the world onely for this End; God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50233:9"/>has judg'd our whole Lives little enough for this great work, and can we pretend that we are not able to ſpare eight or ten days in ayear for it.</p>
               <p>A Fit of ſickneſs makes us quit all our buſineſs to look after our health; we think our ſelves bound to lay aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de all affaires for whole Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, rather then neglect a ſuit at Law, or hazard the loſs of an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, or expoſe a Friend or Relation to ruine who depends wholly upon our care &amp; diligence: Are we not as much concern'd to recover out of a ſtate of ſin as to be cur'd of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Is not Heaven worth more then an Eſtate? And what greater miſery can we fall into then to be viſibly in danger of damnation.</p>
               <p>But we hope to make uſe of the firſt leiſure our buſineſs will allow us, to think of our ſalvation; A las! if we don't reſolve to find leiſure for it, our buſineſs will never allow us any: Let us be not leſs indifferent for ſalvation, let us but look upon this as a real buſineſs, and we shall very eaſily find eight or ten days to employ
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50233:10"/>only in it, in this buſineſs of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>'Tis very ſurprizing that the moſt innocent ſouls who have the leaſt need of Retreat, never think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe without it; The moſt Apoſtolical men who live in the world only to ſanctify it, are yet in continual fear of being corrupted by it: Thoſe holy ſouls who never looſe the preſence of God are yet ſenſible of diſtractions even in the moſt fervent Exerciſes of their zeal: The moſt Heroick Chriſtians interrupt their labours from time to time, to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves in ſolitude, and think it the only preſervative, againſt the corruptions of the world, and the moſt certains means to obtain new ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Even the moſt exact Religious whoſe whole Life is a continual Retreat, do not find themſelves enough retired: And yet men of a very ſlender virtue in compariſon of them, who are every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the greateſt dangers, who live in a conſtant diſſipation of mind, in the midſt of a world which they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50233:10"/>themſelves own to be extremely wicked, and in which they confeſs it is very hard to be ſaved; Can ſuch men as theſe imagine that a Retreat of eight or ten days is not fit for them? can they deceive themſelves with the falſe execuſe of want of time? when they are even weary of idleneſs; when they dont know how to employ themſelves; when the greateſt part of their Lives is ſpent in vain amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſements and diverſions. Can ſuch want time. Certainly if they would confeſs the truth they muſt own that they want not time, but will.</p>
               <p>Our Saviours Parable of the high way where the ſeed of the word of God is trodden down and carryed away by the Birds of the Ayr, is a juſt deſcription of theſe buſy men, allways taken up with the affaires of the world: Now ſince we cannot be ſaved if we do not make a right uſe of the Grace of God, ſince this heavenly ſeed cannot ſpring up in an heart expos'd to noiſe and tumult, It is evident that we are under a kind of neceſſity either to retire our ſelves ſometimes from the world
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50233:11"/>or to renounce all hopes of being ſaved.</p>
               <p>But ſome object, what will peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay if they ſee me go into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to think only on Eternity? How shall I be ridicul'd and laugh'd at? Good God! How long shall ſuch idle apprehenſions ſtifle the moſt moſt noble ſentiments, make men reject the grace of God, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their beſt reſolutions! what can they ſay? that you have really a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaved, and that you take the beſt method for it: All wiſe men will eſteem you, many will imitate you, none but Libertines will bla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me ſuch a truly Chriſtian conduct; the rayllery's of ſuch are reall praiſes and you ought not at all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned' what they ſay or think.</p>
               <p>Men are not asham'd to paſs whole days at play and in vanity, of which they will certainly repent one day if they have not done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and can they be affraid to ſpend eight days in the compaſs of every year, in preparing for another Life? in ſecuring their Salvation?</p>

               <head>CHAP II. <hi>Of the great importance of making one day's Retreat every Month.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Tis not very hard to make men ſenſible that a ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat is an excellent means to amend our Lives and work out our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the difficulty lyes in perſuading them that they may find time for it if they will: Eight days ſeem very long to them, and indeed there are many who cannot ſpare ſo much time together.</p>
               <p>Multitude of buſineſs, the care of a family, want of health, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty's of their callings, are the reaſons or pretences where by ſome excuſe themſelves from making a retreat of eight days: but no man can pretend that he his not able to allow one day in a month to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſe. Is any thing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then this? He may chooſe what day he pleaſes which renders it as eaſy as it is uſeful.</p>
               <p>You are deſir'd toſpend one day
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50233:12"/>in a Month to take care of what concerns you more then all things in the world, to apply your ſelves to the great buſineſs of your Life upon which Eternity depends: that when you have ſpent a whole month in what you call buſineſs, &amp; which is rather the buſineſs of others then your own, you would give one day to the only buſineſs that regards your ſelf: that after having labour'd for the world, you would labour one day for everlaſting happineſs.</p>
               <p>Would any man refuſe one day in a Month to ſerve his Friend? Alas! how many do men looſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month in vain pleaſure, in play, in trifling folly'? you are deſir'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend but one for your ſoul; you muſt ſurely be very indifferent for ſalvation, and very careleſs of what becomes of you hereafter if you refuſe it. Eſpecially ſince the following Chapters will render this practiſe ſo very eaſy that it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one reaſonably to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it.</p>
               <p>How induſtrious are Merchants to improve every opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquiring
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50233:12"/>Riches? How exact are they in ſtating their accounts from time to time, and obſerving how they thrive, what they have gain'd or loſt? Thus let us take one day at leaſt to examine carefully the ſtate of our Conſciences and what progreſs we make in virtue.</p>
               <p>The great benefit of this Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian practiſe is viſible; all ſorts of men may find good by it; 'tis very efficacious to reclaim ſinners from their diſorders and make them return to God, to confirm the virtuous and to elevate them to the higheſt degree of Chriſtian perfection.</p>
               <p>Beſides the uſefulneſs of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the moſt important truths of Religion, it is almoſt impoſſible that a man who ſets aſide his moſt ſerious buſineſs and retires from the world to employ one day every Month in the ſerious conſideration of the ſtate of his ſoul, should not ſucceed. God who ſeeks us with ſo much patience when we fly from him, and who is not weary of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering us mercy not with ſtanding our refuſals, but calls on us even
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50233:13"/>when our earneſtneſſ after the world makes us deaf to his call, will never hide himſelfe from thoſe who come ſo often to meet him in the midſt of ſolitude: he will never refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe abundantly to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who withdraw themſelves from all things to hearken to him.</p>
               <p>Neither our condition nor our employements require this of us nor do we do it out of cuſtom or oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation which is ſo inſeparable from other acts of Piety: none of all theſe lead us to Retreat; nothing but a ſincere deſire to work out our ſalvation can bring us there; and can a ſincere deſire be ineffectual? Can it be attended with small profit? 'Tis hardly poſſible that a man who ſets a part one day in a month to ſtudy the methods of living well, should live diſorderly: Nor is he in danger of being ſurpriz'd by Death who ſo frequently and ſo exactly prepares for it.</p>
               <p>But the importance of this Retreat will appear much greater if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the neceſſity we lye under to reflect often on the great verity's of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50233:13"/>our Faith. Tis from the want of this Reflection that we ſee ſo few Chriſtians live up to the purity of their Profeſſion. We ſee but few truly virtuous tho they are oblig'd to be ſo in a very high degree, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe men ſeldom reflect on the divine Truths: they content themſelves with ſubmitting their Reaſon to Faith, they think it enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: But tho we do not find many infidels in the Church, yet Jam a fraid wee find fewer Chriſtians who ſeriouſly conſider what they believe And this is the Reaſon that what we believe of the End of our Creation, of the small number of the elect, of the pains of Hell, and of everlaſting miſery, make ſo ſlight an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on us. <hi>This</hi> want of Reflection has allway's been and ſtill is the uſual cauſe of our ſins, of our return to them after we have reſolv'd to quit them, and of our <hi>advancing no more</hi> in piety.</p>
               <p>For as without reflecting on what we read, we shall learn but little by our reading, ſo we shall make small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in virtue if wee do not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50233:14"/>reflect on what we believe. 'Tis generally from ſerious Reflections that great Converſions <hi>ſpring,</hi> and without it the moſt terrible Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Chriſtianity, the moſt ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing accidents, and the moſt ſenſible Graces, will have no great Effect on us.</p>
               <p>Can a man who attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the vanity of the world and all its allurements, who reflects ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly on what he beleives of Hell judgment, and Eternity, who is affected with its rigours, and who foreſees its conſequences. Can ſuch a man refuſe to yield himſelfe to the divine Grace, which allways makes uſe of thoſe happy moments? Tis theſe Reflections that have peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the deſarts, that fill our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents every Day, and that recall ſo many ſinners from their Evill ways. If wee could once perſwade men to reflect of ten, we should find their lives reform'd, we should ſee the ancient fervour of Religious houſtes renew'd; this would be a ſure way to prevent the greateſt diſorders, and to make ſaints.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50233:14"/>
               <p>This is what you are to do in your Retreat; ſpend the day in reflecting ſeriouſly on the great Truths of our Religion, in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your life, and meditating on the points of your Faith. 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Day Reflection which you may eaſily ſee muſt needs be uſeful, and that it concerns you very much to do it well. The Eight days retreat is for the ſame end, but beſides that the length of the Time is afalſe Pretenſe to ſeveral for performing it very careleſſly, this muſt be more profitable, becauſe that is uſually made but once a year, this every month.</p>
               <p>This is no new Devotion, but the practiſe of the greateſt ſaints of Latter ages: Tis to this divine art that <hi>Saint Ignatius</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Society of Jeſus confeſſes, he ow'd his progreſſ in virtue, and therefore he was ſo careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to his Children. By the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Retreats, <hi>Saint Staniſlaus</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſame Society preſerv'd his innocence, and acquird that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der devotion and that admirable Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50233:15"/>in a little time, which he practis'd in an ordinary way of Life. Tis by the ſame Retreats that <hi>Bleſſed Lewis Gonzaga</hi> more illuſtrious by his ſanctity then by his birth, arriv'd to that ſublime perfection for which we admire him. And 'tis without doubt from theſe Examples that we ſee it ſo frequently practis'd by thoſe truly pious ſouls who deſire to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce towards perfection.</p>
               <p>But the firſt and great Example of theſe frequent and short Retreats is Chriſt himſelf who often withdrew from the multitude that followed him, and even from his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to ſome mountain or deſart, and the benefit which is daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by this practiſe is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof that it is pleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>We need not ſeek this ſolitude out of our own houſes, we need not neglect our buſineſſ or omit any of the Duty's of our calling; How many Sondays and Holidays are there in every Month? we may chooſe one of theſe, &amp; that in which we shall have moſt leiſure:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50233:15"/>all that is deſir'd of you is to retrench a viſit or two to deny your ſelves ſome hours of diverſion, and ſuch frivolous occupations, that you may the better take care of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And can you be ſo much your own Enemy as to think Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs do's not deſerve one Day in thirty?</p>
               <p>You muſt certainly think heaven worth very little, if it be not worth your trying ſo efficacious and ſo eaſy a method to obtain it. In reality tho it coſt you never ſo much, you cannot buy the bleſſing of a good Conſcience too dear: that inward peace which ſurpaſſes imagination, that ſweet confidence in the mercy of God, and all thoſe innumerable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which are the conſtant fruits of this care of your ſalvation, can never be bought dear; is one day too much for this great work?

Let us then oppoſe a generous and fix'd reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good will to the artifices of the Tempter, and all theſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming difficulties will ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
               <p>This uſeful and neceſſary devotion is proper for all ſorts of Chriſtians
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50233:16"/>of what ſtate or condition ſo ever: 'Tis equally beneficial to Religious and ſeculars, they who are not yet converted, they who begin to ſeek perfection, &amp; they who are already advanc'd in the way, will all find profit by it.

               <head>CHAP III. <hi>Of the Diſpoſitions in which we muſt be, be to make the Retreat with Profit.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE benefit of all pious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes depends very much on our motives, on the diſpoſitions of our ſouls, and on the means of performing them. We can have no ill motive in ſo holy a practiſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſincere deſire to amend our Lives and to increaſe in virtue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50233:18"/>can lead us to retreat? it is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely we should have other motives; ſelfe Love and pride cannot pleaſe themſelves here becauſe there is no noiſe or oſtentation: Let us now take a view of the diſpoſitions &amp; methods whereby we may receive moſt profit. A ſence of our want of it, and a perſuaſion that this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe may be very uſeful to us is one good diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The reſt which we ought to have if we would receive benefit; are almoſt the ſame which the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>retreat</hi> according to the ſpirit &amp; methode of <hi>Saint Ignatius</hi> ſets down in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and they are chiefly five.</p>
               <p>The firſt is an unfeigned deſire to think ſeriouſly of our ſalvation; a firm Reſolution not to flatter our ſelvs, but to examine carefully and axactly without diſguiſing any thing, the ſtate of our ſouls, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſ we make in the way of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, what benefit we receive by the ſacraments, what ground we gain, whether we be victorious over our ſelves, and whether we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50233:18"/>a ſtate as we would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to appear before God in to give an account of our Lives, In fine whether we be ſuch now, as we would deſire to be at the hour of Death.</p>
               <p>But all our examinations and diſcovery's will be to no purpoſe, unleſſ we add to them a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to correct what ever is amiſſ: this is not one of thoſe barren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions which for the moſt part ſerve only to amuſe the imperfect and render them more faulty; they who have not a real deſign and an earneſt deſire to walk with God, will find but little ſatisfaction in it; their coldneſſ and indifference will ſoon make them weary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Diſpoſition</hi> is an humble diſtruſt of our ſelves, ſupported by a firm confidence in God, knowing that ſalvation is chiefly his work, and that without him we can do nothing; aſſuring our ſelves that ſince he hath inſpir'd us with the deſire of retiring once a month, he will not refuſe us the neceſſary graces to profit by it, And indeed this deſire of making uſe of the beſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50233:19"/>means to convert our ſelves to God is an evident proof that he who inſpires it would fain have us turn and live; and we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that thoſe unhappy men who dye in their ſins are ſuch as made but very litle uſe of this excellent means <hi>of Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third Diſpoſition</hi> is a free heart, that gives its ſelfe to God without reſerve, ſaying with <hi>Saint Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord what wouldſt thou have me to do;</hi> or with <hi>David, My heart is ready, O God my heart is ready to do thy will.</hi> The want of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the cauſe that the moſt pious practiſes are without effect.</p>
               <p>For when we think of an entire converſion we are too often irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; we will, &amp; will not; we know not what we would have; and very often we imagine that we deſire what we really and indeed do not deſire. We are for capitulating with our maker, we are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome part of what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him, we deliberate on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he requires, we diſpute
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50233:19"/>with him on every occaſion. My God! what is it we fear? to throw our ſelves entirely on thee? we are convinc'd that 'tis the beſt thing we can do, but we are unwilling to do it, becauſe we foreſee that if we once give our ſelves to thee we shall ſoon grow weary of the Creatures; The communications of thy ſelf to us will not fail to render us ſenſible of vanity, and make us loath them, and we are unwilling to be made ſenſible of it, or to loath them; this is what we fear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Diſpoſition</hi> is a ponctual obſervance of the order and rule of our Rerreat, an exactneſſ in every part of it, neglecting nothing that can contribute to our doing it well, judging nothing little that is capable of advancing ſo great a work as our ſalvation, being fully perſuaded of this Truthe, that the great profit of this devotion depends on exactneſſ in the leaſt things. Whether it be that this carefulneſſ is an evident proof of our ſincerity, or that it prevails with God to refuſe none of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50233:20"/>to thoſe who neglect nothing to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth diſpoſition</hi> which is at is were the ſoul of all ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats is, a perfect ſolitude both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, keeping our ſelves in a profound recollection and ſilence. And avoiding every thing that can any way diſtract us.</p>
               <p>When an indolent ſoul is eight or ten days in retreat the Devil eaſily finds ſome occaſion to diſguſt it with its holy employment: it thinks the time long when it has none but God to converſe with. When it do's not find many ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſolations in prayer, when its thoughts are almoſt continually diſtracted, its want of fervour and the imperfection of its deſires to be converted, render the moſt holy exerciſes of devotion very unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; Eight days in Retreat ſeem an age, ſo that it counts all the hours and wishes for the laſt. But to theſe dangers we are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in one day's Retreat: 'tis but one day and if we make a right
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50233:20"/>uſe of it we may gain as much, and perhaps more profit then in a longer Retreat; which ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to engage us to neglect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby we may improve ſuch a precious ſeaſon to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>One Day in thirty is but a small matter, let us give it heartily and cheerfully to God; let us be very exact in the performance of the ſpiritual excerciſes that we may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve nothing to reproach our ſelves. One day is quickly over, and it will be our unſpeakable comfort to have paſt it well.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50233:21"/>receive the ſame day: Men of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſ and tradeſmen would do well to chooſe an Holiday, &amp; Religious men ſome day wherein they can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout diſtraction give themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to this holy exerciſe.</p>
               <p>We should endeavour to ſpend halfe an hour in Meditation the night before to diſpoſe us for the duty's of the day, at leaſt, we should read attentively the preparatory Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion compos'd for that end, and if we have opportunity we should at the ſame time &amp; with the ſame deſign viſit our Redeemer in the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve a profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence during the whole Day, to which we muſt add an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection: we muſt ſpend it in exact ſolitude, as far as our condition will permit, but we are not hereby oblig'd to neglect any of the duty's of our calling, nor are Religious perſons forbid their ordinary recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; much leſſ the Dutys of their vocation. We muſt make this Day the three Meditations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for each Month, and paſſ an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50233:21"/>hour in reflecting on the practical Truths of Religion; our <hi>Confeſſion</hi> should be larger and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar then ordinary that we may the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby endeavour to repair the faults of former <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> &amp; chiefly to excite a true contrition in our hearts, wherein in all ſorts of people and even the beſt Chriſtians are too often faulty.</p>
               <p>We muſt hear <hi>Maſſ</hi> and receive as if were to be our laſt <hi>Communion,</hi> and we muſt perform all the other exerciſes in the ſame diſpoſition. Prieſts should examin themſelves particularly whether their Lives are ſuitable to the Holineſſ of their Character, whether they celebrate with ſuch affection as become men who are really penetrated with what they profeſſ to believe. Let them offer that adorable Sacrifice with ſuch a fervent Devotion that this Days Maſſ may be an atonement for the faults they have been guilty of in all the reſt, and be a model of thoſe they shall ſay for the future: making it their great buſineſſ to profit by this, more than they have yet done.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50233:22"/>
               <p>We muſt be very careful to keep ourſelves retir'd, and to avoid every thing that can poſſibly diſtract us: there us no danger of thinking the time long; we shall find em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for every moment; and one day ſo fill'd up is ſoon paſs'd it is but a day, let us make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a day of retreat; all the time we are not in the Church, we should keep our ſelves shut up in our Chamber; and indeed it would be well to do moſt of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes in the Chamber, unleſſ we have conveniency of being as much retir'd before the <hi>bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe this Exerciſe is very uſefull to all ſorts of men, and the great eſt part cannot meditate, I have calculated theſe Meditations for the greater number; to that end, I have made them long that they may find matter enough to take them up for an hour together: that the very reading of them may be truly à Meditation, and that they may be profitable.</p>
               <p>Such as can meditate may make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50233:22"/>uſe of what part of them they find moſt for their purpoſe; but theſe as well as the others muſt be very careful to avoid a fault to which moſt who meditate on the truths of our Religion are too ſubject. They muſt not content themſelves with believing them, and think their work done when they are once convinced; It is not enough to believe thoſe important Truths, the Devils believe as much, perhaps more then we and tremble. We muſt not ſtop at ſpeculation we muſt reduce them to practiſe. Our Meditations muſt all tend to reform us. 'Tis not ſufficient to read, and believe the Truth of what we read, we muſt attentively conſider every point and apply it to our ſelves. We muſt examine its conſequences, and make thoſe reflexions on them as we would do if we were on our death bed, when we know we shall have little or no time left to profit by them.</p>
               <p>Let this be your way of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if you read, do it with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50233:23"/>pauſe upon each paſſage that affects you moſt, Put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to your ſelfe, is this true? have I liv'd up to theſe Rules? what is it they require of me for the future? And then reflect ſeriouſly on the diſmall conſequences atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your negligence, if this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcovery do not produce more fruit then your former Meditations have yet done.</p>
               <p>You need not trouble your ſelf to read the whole Meditation; if one ſingle reflection take up all the hour provided you receive good by it you have ſpent that hour well; And the reſt of the Meditation may ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve you to read ſome other time of the day which is not abſolutely allotted to ſome particular exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>A right conſideration is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and therefore to be carefully perform'd. It conſiſts in reading with application the Reflections at the end of the Book: you may paſſ lightly over thoſe which <hi>are leſſ</hi> ſuitable to you, and dwell longer on ſuch heads as you find affect you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50233:23"/>moſt; and which are moſt proper for you.</p>
               <p>Beſides the hour uſually ſpent after dinner in conſideration, it would be well to allott half an hour in the morning for Religious men to reflect on the obſervation of their Rules, and others on the duty's of their particular callings; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exactly wherein they have fail'd, and preſcribing to themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves ſuch methods as may be moſt efficacious for their amendment: if we cannot ſpate half an hour we may divide the hour of conſideration, one half for general reflections, and the ſecond for thoſe that concern our particular Rules and the duty's of our Callings.</p>
               <p>And here we are always to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we muſt not content our ſelves in theſe ſpiritual exerciſes to form good deſigns, and take ſtrong reſolutions of changing our Lives; it is to no purpoſe to reſolve though we ſeem to do it never ſo ſincerely, unleſſ we likewiſe fix the particular means, and methods, by which we may effectually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50233:24"/>what we have reſolv'd.</p>
               <p>It is not our buſineſſ to read much; let u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We have already obſerv'd that Religious perſons are not hereby diſpens'd from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of their Community's, nor even from their uſual recreations; but having diſcover'd by their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, the faults they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to in thoſe Exerciſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, they should begin that very Day to reap the benefit of their Retreat, by beginning to correct themſelves and reform thoſe faults, carrying themſelves in every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50233:24"/>
               <p>The great deſign of this ſpiritual Retreat being to prepare us for Death, I have compos'd a third Meditation on the ſentiments we shall have in that laſt hour, to be read in every Retreat. And it being the moſt proper ſubject for the End I propos'd to my ſelfe, I judg'd the ſame Meditation might be renew'd every Month.</p>
               <p>The chief benefit we are to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve by this pious Exerciſes being a reformation of all the faults we have diſcover'd in our ſelves ſince the laſt Retreat, a more earneſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for perfection, the getting the Victory over our favourite Paſſion, a more ardent Love to our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, particularly in the adorable Sacrament, and a greater exactneſſ in all our Duty's, we are at the begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of each Retreat to propoſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe things to our ſelves as the end for which we make it. And ſeeing it is a direct preparation for Death, we are to come out of it in ſuch a ſtate, as we would deſire to be in, if we were immediately to dye. And we muſt be careful to keep our ſelves
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50233:25"/>in the ſame diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>General reſolutions are commonly uſeleſs and to no purpoſe, our beſt way is to pitch upon ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fault, which may be the ſubject of our daily Examination, and to regulate the means which we will every day employ, to reform it, till the next Retreat.</p>
               <p>And the better to preſerve thoſe Good diſpoſitions we should firſt render thanks to God for the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he has beſtow'd on us during the Retreat. We should then offer up all our Reſolutions to him, and renew them with more earneſtneſſ; beſeeching the Bleſſed Virgin to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us with her ſon, that he would give us his Grace where by we way be render'd faithful to the End, and begging that she would undertake for our fidelity, which she can obtain for us.</p>
               <p>But after all theſe Reſolutions, we muſt not rely ſo much upon them as to forget our weakneſſ; for nothing is more dangerous then too much ſecurity.</p>
               <p>It very much concerns us, to be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50233:25"/>exact in our watch, the firſt three or four Days; after this we shall find the difficulty'is leſſen, ſo that we shall execute our reſolutions with Eaſe; The greateſt difficulties are in the beginning, and the ſureſt way to maintain our fervour is, without any delay to declare our ſelves for virtue.</p>

                     <hi>Conſider</hi> with what care God hath hitherto cultivated us that we might bring forth fruit. We came into the world not only a barren tree but corrupted and ſpoil'd by original Sin, fit for nothing but to be caſt into Hell Fire. The ſingular Mercy of God has preferr'd us to many others, has planted us in his Church by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us Chriſtians, or in the fertile field of a Religious Life, if by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect of his Love he has call'd us to that ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Have we ever truly known the advantage of being planted in this holy ground, cultivated by the labours and water'd by the ſweat and blood of him who is both God and man? This ground in which we are hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd thoſe Hero's of Chriſtianity, and bears every day a multitude of ſaints, of all ſexes, ages, &amp; conditions. Thoſe excellent fouls with the ſame manuring, that is with the ſame aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is given us, have and do every day bring forth fruit worthy of Eternal Life. They had no other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50233:26"/>Goſpel, no other Sacraments then we have; The Grace of God abounds at all times; ther Rules were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours, only they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re faithful to thoſe Rules, by the exact obſervation of which alone, they are become great ſaints. We have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Examples, and many proper helps which they wanted.</p>
                  <p>Add to theſe advantages, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favours we have receiv'd from God; call to mind all the pains he hath taken to make us fruitful; all the good thoughts he hath inſpir'd us with; all the pious Reſolutions he hath excited in us ſince we had the uſe of Reaſon; his favours have been innumerable ſince we have been in his ſervice: how often hath he nourish'd us with the food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, his owne flesh? how often have we heard him ſpeaking to our hearts? how often has he enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us? how many Graces have we receiv'd from him in our Retreats, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ommunions? and and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other favours hath he heap'd on us.</p>
                  <p>Half theſe are ſufficient to make
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50233:27"/>a great ſaint; nay there are many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits now in heaven who never had all theſe advantages and yet they bare much fruit: They made admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable uſe of their talents; their Lives were full of good works, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve adorn'd them with merits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they now poſſeſs everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſ, a juſt reward of their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Let us now conſider ſeriouſly and impartially, whether the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuring &amp; the ſpinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, have made us like bear much fruit.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50233:28"/>to cultivate us theſe three, theſe ten years, that we might be fruitful; many would have been ſaints with much leſs Graces, and yet all have not perhaps made one good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or one good Chriſtian. 'Tis not the fault of the ground in which Jam planted, it is holy ground and yields an hundred fold, even many of my accquaintance with leſſ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages bring forth much more fruit then I.</p>
                  <p>What benefit have I receiv'd by ſo many Maſſes? what am I the better for ſo many Communions; One ſingle Communion is able to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a ſoul to a ſublime perfection, yet I who have receiv'd it may be one or two hundred times have not yet reform'd any one fault. After ſo many Devotions am I more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more exact, more mortifyed? Do I love my God and Saviour more?</p>
                  <p>What is become of all the good thoughts I have formerly had? where is all my fervour? what is become of that inward peace and true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I have ſometimes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien'cd

                  <p>Has not our ingratitude towards God augmented proportionably to the increaſe of his bleſſings? And do's it not ſeem that his care to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke us fruitful, ſerves only to make us more unprofitable? But that which ought to humble us more is, that after having ſpent ten or twenty years in the way of Perfection, we should think ourſelves happy to be as much advanc'd as as we were when we began. Yet ſtill the time paſſes, and the year draws towards an end, when the owner weary of the barrenneſs of his Fig-tree after ſo much pains, is reſolv'd to cut it down &amp; caſt it into the Fire.</p>

                     <p>We are then in the world only to ſerve God, this is the End of all Men; but do all men live for that End? this is the only thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which the ſon of God ſpeaks in the Goſpel, do we look upon it as ſuch?</p>
                     <p>How earneſt are we to accomplish our deſigns? to acquit ourſelves, well of our employments, and to ſerve our Princes? Are we as earneſt to ſerve God? do not men generally act as if they valued every thing but him? How often is the title of a man of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50233:33"/>Gown or of the ſword, prefer'd to that of Gods ſervant? How often do the Maxims of the World get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Duty's of a Chriſtian?

                     <p>This Truth of Gods being our End is one of the firſt Tru h's we learn, yet it is that which we think leaſt of, and are leaſt affected with when we do think of it.

For if be true that I live in this world only to ſerve God, then every one of my actions ought to be directed to him, and it may be I have not in all my Life done any one ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely for him.</p>
                     <p>This is the fundamental Verity of our Religion, do we live up to this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50233:34"/>important Truth? The whole Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is founded on this as its chief maxime, but who that examines our manner &amp; our maxims can think that God is our ultimate End? We think of every thing but God, as if we thought him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>We find time for every thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for loving and ſerving God, we are delighted with riches, honours, and pleaſures, God alone hath no charms for us: And yet where can we find any true pleaſure but in him only?

He did from the beginning deſign our Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in creating us for his Glory; &amp; ſeeing that Eternal happineſs is no otherwiſe propos'd then as a reward, our whole life is given us only that we may deſerve it by obedience to thoſe Laws and Commandments which he hath made for that End. And the deſire of happineſs which is natural to every man do's as it were by inſtinct advertiſe us in the midſt of our diſorders that we are plac'd in the world only to work out our Eternal ſalvation in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The Checks of our Conſciences which are hardly ever quite ſtifled, cry loud to us that we put our ſelves in danger of being loſt when we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

And are not the fears of hell, and of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements of God, which shake the moſt hardned ſinners, a ſufficient monitor telling us inceſſantly that we are in the world only to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
                     <p>This is the only buſineſs of all the world, this is our laſt End, we are not here to obtain great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments or dignity's, to render out ſelves excellent in this or that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, nor to eſtablish a reputation by our good qualities; You are rais'd to that dignity, you are put in that dignity, you are put in that ſtation, God has given you thoſe qualitys, &amp; made you ſucceſſful only that theſe may be helps to your ſalvation, may be the means to bring you more eaſily to him your laſt End.</p>
                     <p>We are then created only that we may be ſaved, that we may avoid an Eternity of woe in Hell, and obtain an happineſs in Paradiſe which shall never end.

                     <p>But do we look upon our ſelves as ſuch? Have we theſe thoughts of Heaven? would any one that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines our conduct think that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our ſalvation to be our laſt End?

Will thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded friends be much oblig'd to us for having ruin'd our ſelves to pleaſe them? shall we be much oblig'd to them who are the cauſe of our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and for whoſe ſakes we are loſt?</p>

                     <p>'Tis ſurpriſing that men who love themſelves ſo much should reflect ſo little on a matter of this conſequence: that men who in all other things are wiſe and prudent, should yet every day go out of the world without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once ſeriouſly conſidered why they were ſent into it, whence they came, and whither they are to go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death.

                     <p>O Divine ſaviour! where is that paſſionate deſire of our ſalvation which mov'd thee to do ſuch great things? How long wilt thou ſuffer ſo many ſouls to be loſt, for whom

I have not indeed made a right uſe of my happineſs in being deſign'd only for thee, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve forgot thee to place my affections upon the Creatures. I have wander'd out of the way that leads to my laſt End, and refus'd to obey the voyce of the good shepherd who call'd me. But now I ſee and repent of my wandring; however unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful I have been, the ſence thou haſt given me of my unfaithfulneſſ, makes me hope that thou wilt have mercy on me: thou lovedſt me when I did not love thee, and when I did all I could to make thee hate me thou ſought'ſt even when I fled moſt from thee.

                     <p>I acknowledge that I was made

                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that God not content to have created us for himſelfe as for our ultimate End, has out of his great goodneſs indiſpenſably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd us to ſeek him, by thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous meanes which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to attain that End. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature taken in its ſelfe is an help to our knowledge &amp; Love of him; And 'tis only our abuſe of them that makes any of them hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances. The happineſs and mis fortunes of our Lives, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50233:40"/>wherewith God corrects our unfaithfulneſs, &amp; our very faults, may be ſo many furtherances of our Salvation. Even the devices and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of our mortal Enemy the Devil, may be a means to ſave us.</p>
                     <p>Without grace it is impoſſible to attain our ultimate End; all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours without it are vain; 'Tis an article of Faith that we may be wanting to the Grace of God: there is not one ſoul in Hell who is not damn'd by his own fault.</p>
                     <p>We are weak the occaſions of ſin are many, and our corrupted hearts are violently enclin'd to it, but can we have greater aſſiſtance to prevent our falls, and to raiſe us up again when we are fallen? Are we ſenſible of the facility with which we may work out our ſalvation if we will have recourſe to thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means which God hath put into our hands? So many Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby all the merits of our Saviour are apply'd to us, in which we are as it were bath'd in his blood,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50233:40"/>where in our ſouls feed on the Body and Blood of that Divine Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are without doubt moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and eaſy means to attain our great End.</p>
                     <p>It was eaſy for the Diſciples to be ſaints who had their Divine Saviour always with them: And shall it be more difficult for us who have him continually preſent in the Euchariſt? their happineſſ conſiſted in having their requeſts granted; what should hinder our obtaining of him as they whatever we deſire.</p>
                     <p>Another very effectual means is frequent Prayer, for our Saviour hath ſolemnly engag'd his word that he will grant whatever we ask in his Name.</p>
                     <p>His promiſes are without exception, not limited to any Sort of men: Do but ask. Every body ſurely is able to ask, and they who will not do moſt certainly value Heaven at a very low rate ſince they think it not worth their asking.</p>
                     <p>If we had only the Sacrifice of the Altar, would nor our Salvation be ſure? what Grace, what aſſiſtance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50233:41"/>can we need which our Redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And how can we doubt his ſo often reiterated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he deſires our happineſſ? We are all debtors to the juſtice of God, and ſtand in need of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary helps; One Maſſ, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion beſtows on us a treaſure ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pay all our debts and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all our needs. Let us offer up that Hoſt to his Eternal Father. Who we are ſure cannot but be pleas'd with it; It is ſufficient to blot out the ſins of all mankind; and whoſe fault will it be, if it do's not efface ours?</p>
                     <p>Certainly if God had left it to us to chooſe the moſt proper means of Salvation, we should never have been able to find ſo many, ſo eaſy; and ſo effectual; we sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

What shall we anſwer when our Saviour himſelfe reproaches and confounds us with the example of thoſe Pagans who only out of a vain deſire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; for an imaginary recompenſe, were ſuch lovers of virtue ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of vice, &amp; even ſuperſtitiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly devout? what would they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve done if they had enjoy'd our helps.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50233:43"/>lukewarm, and have more reaſon to fear, tho we ſeem to have made great progreſs: 'tis becauſe we neglect the particular meanes which we have in our own hands, this renders all the reſt ineffectual: As the beſt Phyſick do's us more harm then good when we neglect the leaſt precautions.</p>
                     <p>Let not a Religious man who is careleſs of obſerving his Rule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any benefit by his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; Let not a worldly perſon who hath no care of his family, who neglects the Duty's of his particular ſtation, expect to be the better for all his pretended good works, How should we like a ſervant that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes never ſo well, that do's never ſo many good things, if he do's not his Duty: And how can he do his Duty who do's not do what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter commands?</p>
                     <p>Let us now reflect ſeriouſly on our conduct; what uſe have we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the meanes of ſalvation? have we improv'd the particular?</p>
                     <p>God will not only examine and ſeverely punish the Evil we have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but the Good we have not done
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50233:44"/>when it was in our power, and the good we have not done well. Are we ready to give an account of our Lives immediately? all the actions of our Lives should have God for their End, and can we find one among them all, that was done only for him?</p>
                     <p>Let us inquire what can be the cauſe, that the Sacraments, and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes have hitherto done us ſo little good. Let us impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what uſe we have made of the meanes of perfection that are in our hands. If we be engag'd in the world, how have we diſcharg'd the duty's of our condition? If we be Religious or Eccleſiaſtiques, how have we acquited our ſelves of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and obſerv'd our Rule? By this examination we shall be able to excite an hearty ſorrow for our paſt faults, and to make ſuch Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may be effectual for our futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re amendment.</p>

                     <head>FIRST POINT.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> how ſtrangely a dying man is chang'd; he who a few days ago was ſtrong and in perfect health, enjoying his Riches and honours and contriving great projects, is all on a ſudden confin'd to his bed,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50233:45"/>reduc'd to extremity, unable to help himſelfe, incapable of pleaſure, forc'd to abandon all, &amp; to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by all, My God! what is man? tho never ſo Rich and great; ſince a few hours ſickneſs are able to make him uſeleſs to all the world, and render all the world of no uſe to him.</p>
                     <p>We think our ſelves happy when we have Riches enough to ſerve us many years, but alas! what are we the better for many years, riches if we have not many years, to enjoy them?</p>
                     <p>What is able to comfort a ſinner in this miſerable condition? when the remembrance of paſt pleaſures leave only a mortal regret behind them; &amp; the fear of future pains makes him already begin to feel them. When God and man, when every thing in the world conſpire to terrify and affright him. How do the tears of Friends cut him to the heart, and the Aſſiſtants encreaſe his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? how ſenſible muſt the grief of his wife, the tears of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the hurry of his ſervants
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50233:46"/>be to him? with what fear has he recourſe to deſperate remedies, and what a terror is it to find thoſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ineffectual?</p>
                     <p>And when to calm his frights his Confeſſor approaches, can we think that the ſight of him allay's his trouble? he ſweats &amp; is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; and in this agony he is to prepare for death, but is this a fit time, is he in a condition to prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? when fear and trouble has we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akned and clouded his Reaſon, how can he go about it? He ſpeaks not his own thoughts or ſentiments, he onely repeats what he hears his Confeſſor ſay, he neither knows what he ſays, nor what he ought to ſay.</p>
                     <p>Even Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe whoſe preſence in this laſt hour is the great conſolation of a dying Saint, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the dying ſinner only to upbraid him. &amp; make him more ſenſible of his impiety's. And indeed what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can he expect from the laſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments being ſo ill prepar'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them?</p>
                     <p>With whom shall he find eaſe?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50233:46"/>For as ſoon as he has receiv'd the rights of the Church, his friends, and Relations retire. Let us now conſider what his thoughts will be when the Prieſt only ſtays to preſent him the Crucifix, &amp; inform him that there is no farther hopes of recovery, that now being bereft of all Creatures, Jeſus Chriſt alone muſt be his refuge and conſolation. Jeſus Chriſt crucifyed muſt be now your only hope, you muſt ſeek ſtrength in thoſe ſacred wounds, againſt the fear of Death, for they are able to ſoften all its rigours, to ſwee ten its bitterneſs: receive then Dear Brother this comfortable Object, in whoſe Arms I leave you.</p>
                     <p>This is the End of all the vain projects, of all the greatneſs, and pleaſures of worldly men; In what a condition is a libertine who has neglected Jeſus Chriſt all his Life, which he has ſpent in ſin and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and in an extreme careleſsneſs of Eternity? what conſolation can he find now in holding a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50233:47"/>in his hand?</p>
                     <p>If he has no reſſemblance of a crucify'd Jeſus: he was never ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected with the terrible verity's of our holy Religion, but laugh'd at the moſt ſerious Exerciſes of Piety, what thoughts can he have when he has nothing but a Crucifix to entertain himſelfe withal?</p>
                     <p>He may indeed make a good uſe of the little time that is left; but alas! his weakneſſ and feares do compoſe his Reaſon, and do not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve him the Liberty that is neceſſary to uſe it well.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Sick man dyes and there is little hope that the prayers of the Church should give him any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion, they are indeed full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for thoſe who dye well, but what comfort can they afford a dying ſinner whom every word reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with the diſorders of his Life?</p>
                     <p>What terror muſt it be to him to hear the Prieſt pronounce thoſe words,
<note place="margin">Proficiſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re anima Chriſtiana de hoc mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> 
                        <hi>Christian Soul go out of the world;</hi> to him who lov'd the world
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50233:47"/>ſo much, who perhaps never lov'd any thing elſe nor ever made one ſtep towards Heaven? Go out, there is no more to do; you muſt leave all your delights, tho you be never ſo fond of them, &amp; unwilling to quit them; you would leave nothing but you muſt dye to all.</p>
                     <p>The Charitable recommandation, <hi>May'ſt thou enter into the habitation of peace,</hi>

                     <p>How can be expect any benefit from that petition,
<note place="margin">Miſerere Domine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mituum, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum ejus.</note> 
                        <hi>pity O Lord his ſighs, and let his teares prevail with thee?</hi> if his grief proceeds only from his fondneſs of the world, and if he weeps becauſe he is forc'd to quit it and becauſe he can ſin no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>The prieſt go's on,
<note place="margin">Agnoſce Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam tuam non à Diis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienis crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, ſed à ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Deo vivo &amp; vero.</note> 
                        <hi>Look O Lord upon thy creature, made by thy ſelfe, and not by ſtrange Gods, own the work of thy hands;</hi> But if the dying man has alwayes lov'd the Creature more then his Creator, if his Life
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50233:48"/>has not been at all conformable to the maxims of Chriſt, how can he be like his Saviour in this laſt hour? what muſt he expect ſeeing he is not like him, and how terrible muſt his apprehenſions be of what is to come after Death?</p>
                     <p>Great God! in what a condition is a dying man, torn with grief and deſpair without hope? If he have yet his ſences left, every thing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents its ſelfe, every thing he hears, is an addition to his fear &amp; trouble; and when he has loſt his fences, when external objects can make no more impreſſion on him, then the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of all his Sins, of all the ill he has done, of all the good he has neglected when it was in his power, or which he has done ill, racks and torments him more.</p>
                     <p>How many are his Reflections? yet all to no purpoſe: he then ſees his Error but it is too late to reap any benefit by it: he repents of a great many things, but that repentance adds new force to his torments, becauſe he knows it will do him no good. How dos he grieve for not having
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50233:48"/>done his duty when he was able? how do's he deſpair of being able to do what he has left undone? he would not reflect ſeriouſly on the great Truths of the Goſpell while he might have done it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, now he reflects, and reflects at leiſure, but 'tis a Cruel leiſure, for all the fruit of thoſe Reflections is deſpair &amp; rage.</p>
                     <p>Now he is ſenſible of all the diſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders of his Life, he is now convinc'd of his Error, but its too late. Oh! what muſt the ſentiments of a perſon conſecrated to God be, when he ſees his Eternal condition ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, &amp; remembers how imperfect he hath been in a ſtate which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſo much perfection? to what end did I make ſuch a doe in leaving the world and entring into Religion? <hi>Was</hi> it to follow the maximes of the world there? God hath called me by his Grace to an Eccleſiaſticall or Religious ſtate, have I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de good uſe of that Grace? I quitted all and choſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way of Life, that I might dye in peace by dying like a ſaint; but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50233:49"/>(wretched Creature that I am) did I conſider that an happy Death is the conſequence of an holy Life? How often have I taught others this doctrine? O! why have I made no better uſe of what I taught? How have I been diſtracted in prayer? how many Maſſes and Communions have done me no good? how often have I confeſs'd my ſins without leaving them? how many graces have I rendred uſeleſs? how many good works have I loſt for want of right motives? O my God! why have I taken ſo much pains to loſe my ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe? have left my Relations? been inſenſible to their tears and all their careſſes? ſurmounted ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that I might ſecure my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And, by loving my eaſe too much, by ſetting my heart on trivial matters which one would have been asham'd of in a ſecular ſtate, I have been a lukewarm Religious; I am now on my death bed torn with remor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, oppreſs'd with fear &amp; trouble, and having cauſe to doubt poſitivly of my ſalvation. Oh! 'tis terrible to pay ſo dear for ſuch a Death.</p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50233:49"/>
                     <p>And indeed what elſe can be the conſequence of a careleſs Life? when we come to conſider ſeriouſly as we shall certainly do then, that the leaſt grace we have abus'd was ſufficient to convert an infidel, &amp; yet ſo many of them have ve not made one good Religious, or good Chriſtian. When we shall diſcover a multitude of faults, which we took no notice of before, or which through the violence of our paſſions, and our indifference we took for small ones, but which now appear to be great ſins. What comfort can an imperfect Religious find then? Will he ſeek it from the ſaints of his Order? he hath dishonour'd them by his conduct. Will he ſeek it in his Rule? he has not obſerv'd it. Will he hope to find comfort in God? he hath offended and incens'd him by ſerving him ſo ill, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd ſo many favours from him.</p>
                     <p>How diſmall muſt his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be after an irregular Life? when he reflects, I have but a few hours to live, If I be out of the ſtate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50233:50"/>of Grace I am loſt for ever; and I have not only ſome reaſon to fear that I am not in the ſtate of Grace (which fear the greateſt ſaints have) but cauſe to doubt poſitively that I am not.</p>
                     <p>In this extremity all that he hath heard of judgment, of Hell, &amp; Eternity come afresh in his mind &amp; affright him in a terrible manner. 'Tis wonderful that he who ſome few days ago was full of doubts and uncertaintys, is now fully convinc'd of the truths which he was then ſo unwilling to believe. Behold his fears, ſee how he trembles and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes at the thoughts of Death &amp; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>We ſometimes meet with men who turn the moſt ſerious exerciſes of Piety into Rallery, and call the exactneſs of thoſe fervent ſouls who are punctual in performing the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt dutys of their ſtation, preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs. Let theſe men who imagine they have reaſon to cenſure and act thus, continue to think ſo at this hour, and mantain their character of wits to the laſt if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50233:50"/>they can. If they were in the right, let them pleaſe themſelves now with calling exactneſs, and devotion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs, and ſcrupuloſity. They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve made a falſe conſcience to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; under its shadow they lull themſelves in a falſe ſecurity, let rhem now maintain that imaginary ſyſteme. Alas! 'tis the remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of theſe very things that now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves them to deſpair.</p>
                     <p>While we are in health, our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions blind us, ill examples ſeduce us, we are charm'd with preſent objets, the hurry of buſineſs takes us up, and we induſtriouſly avoid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reflections on the Truths of Religion, even our Faith is halfe dead, ſtifled by the corruption of our manners, but at the approach of Death it revives to terrify, &amp; diſtract us, like the Faith of the Devils, it makes us tremble but do's not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us.</p>
                     <p>Every body is convinc'd that when Death comes we shall repent our neglect of mortification, our worldly voluptuous Lives, our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50233:51"/>done ſo very few good works, and having liv'd no better, and yet which is exceeding ſtrange, after all theſe reflections, after being fully convinc'd of them, how few take pains to amend their Lives? My God! how long shall we make the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe uſeful rections, and yet live ſo unlike Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>Death makes us ſee clearly; then our prejudices, and prepoſſeſſions vanish; formerly we ſaw but were not ſenſible of the vanity &amp; emptineſs of every thing in the world, but now we both ſee and feel it and wonder at our ſtupidity in finding it no ſooner, and in not diſcovering our double want. We find we were deceiv'd and at the ſame time find to our unſpeakable an ſpeakable anguish that we are ruin'd by that Error, and that we cannot recover what it has made us looſe.</p>
                     <p>A Dead man is indeed a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but an uſeful ſight, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſabuſe us, and to alienate our affections from the pleaſures of this Life; the moſt accomplish'd man in the World inſpires horror
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50233:51"/>when he is dead, immediately all is ſilent, the Corps is cover'd, the Curtains drawn, and every body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires: where is now his beauty and good miene? where is his agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humour? what is become of all his projects &amp; great fortune? you ſee what is the end of all. But what is become of his ſoul? &amp; what muſt be done with this corrupted body, which begins already to grow offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive? Not withſtanding all its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, notwithſtanding all its charms, though the moſt Lovely in the world, every body fly's it: Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, wife, Children, Relations, Friends, neighbours, ſervants, are all ſtriving to be rid of it: thoſe who lov'd it beſt are moſt deſirous to have it carried away, and moſt uneaſy to hear it ſpoken of; Its neareſt and beſt friends hire men to throw it to the worms, they make haſt to nail it up, they hide it in the ground, and we cannot without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour think of its condition a few days after.</p>
                     <p>You are forgot as ſoon as bury'd, every one returns to his buſineſs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50233:52"/>your Friends ſeek other Friends, take new meaſures, and hardly think any more of you. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves no more about you then if you had never liv'd, no body fears your anger nor deſires your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they often undo all you had done, within a little time you are not ſo much as talk'd of.</p>
                     <p>At your Death indeed ſome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res may poſſibly be shed by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends, for the loſs of ſome pleaſure or advantage which they expected from you: teares are common, but the greateſt part of thoſe teares are only grimace: they will ſoon be comforted; eſpecially if they gain by your Death, &amp; any part of your Eſtate falls to them. We may gueſs what others will do for us, by what we have done for others after their Death. Our grief for a friend and Relation has been ſoon appeas'd, and though they were ſo wretched as to have ruin'd their ſouls for our ſakes, have we thought our ſelves much oblig'd to them?</p>
                     <p>After all this can we make any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50233:52"/>great account of the world and its pleaſures? 'Tis indeed very ſurpriſing that we think ſo ſeldom of Death, but tis much more ſurprizing that we can think once of it, and not be converted. How many live as if they were ſure they should never dye, &amp; were to dye more then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce? as if they should loſe nothing by dying ill, or as if they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that loſs after Death? Is not this our caſe? And what will our thought, be on a Death Bed, when we call to mind the reflections we now make, if we reape no benefit by them?</p>

And by ſtaying for which he knew ſeveral who came on the ſame buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with him, had loſt their cauſe and their Lives? remembrance of paſt dangers gives us real pleaſure and we delight to talk of them, ſo the difficulties we have gone through for the love of God, will be very ſweet to us at the hour of Death.</p>
                     <p>Did it ever come into a mans thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts on his death bed, to regret that he had not diverted and pleas'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enough in the World?

                     <p>The thoughts of Death terrify the ſtouteſt, &amp; make the wicked trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but they fill the Saints with joy. He is A good man ſays S.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50233:56"/>whom he lov'd with ſo much tenderneſs, &amp; fervour?</p>
                     <p>What a difference is there between the death of a Saint and the death of a wicked man? a difference that is ſeen even after their Death. The Corps of the former inſpires venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not with ſtanding the natural horror we have for dead Bodys, and for every thing about them, <hi>ſo that</hi> we are not unwilling to come near them, neither the body of a Saint nor any thing about it frights us: we are not afraid to enter into the Chamber where it lyes, we are earneſt to get ſome thing that belong'd to it, we kiſs it, we ſtrive to touch it: his death is not only agreeable to him but to us to; ſuch is the power of Holineſs that it takes away all the horror of a Corps and renders it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and precious. We are all charm'd with the Death of a Saint; Is it not then very ſtrange that our deſire to dye like him do's not excite us to live better.</p>
                     <p>We are all ready to ſay with the Prophet, Let me dye the death of the juſt and let my latter end be like

Are we ignorant that the ſatisfaction which the Saints find in Death is the ordinary fruit of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their Lives? we should have liv'd like them, in a continual morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our paſſions, in an entire renouncing &amp; contempt of the world, an uninterrupted practiſe of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtues, and an exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duty's of our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>What is the reaſon that we take no more care to prepare for Death, ſeeing there is nothing of ſo great importance, that all depends upon dying well, and that if whe dye ill we can never repair our loſs? oh! 'tis a wretched thing to be reduc'd in in the laſt moment of our lives to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable regrets.</p>
                     <p>Tho you were the greateſt admirer of the world, thou you were never ſo fond of it there is no more world for you when you are once dead. what do you carry away with you? what reward do's the world give you for having been ſo long its ſlave?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50233:57"/>what vexation, regret, and deſpair for having ſerv'd it? They are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe who leave the world firſt; who do not ſtay till it leaves them, but deſpiſe it, before it deſpiſes them.</p>
                     <p>Tis a ſad ſpectacle to ſee a man carried out of a great houſe which he had newly built or purchas'd, &amp; into which he never muſt return more. All his riches, his goods; and what ever he had in the world is now in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another. Where are all thoſe great men who made ſuch a buſtle in the world and appear'd in ſuch ſplendor? They are gone, they are nothing now, and the world who conſiders men no longer than they are uſeful, thinks no more of them: they are in their graves, their flesh pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify'd, their bones calcin'd, their whole body turn'd into duſt. How little do we think of thoſe who liv'd before us, unleſs it be to blame their actions or publish their faults, And this is all the recompenſe we are to expect even from thoſe whom we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve moſt oblig'd. With what ſatifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would men dye, if they did
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50233:57"/>for God, but the hundred th part of what they do for the world to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</p>
                     <p>My God! what benefit shall I reap by theſe Reflections? what thoughts, what anguish shall I have upon a death bed if theſe conſiderations do not make me fruitfull? Am I ſo fully perſuaded that there is no ſolid ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction but in thee? and shall I ſeek it any where elſe, thou onely canſt make me happy both in Life and in Death?</p>
                     <p>The Saints were wiſe, hated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and kept their body's in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, never ſparing them while they liv'd, why then do not I endeavour to be wiſe after their Example?

                     <p>ALL the world agrees that no thing is of ſo great concern as Death; that it is the moſt difficult thing in the world to dye well; that we can never recover our ſelves if we dye ill; yet there is hardly any thing for which men make ſo little preparation as for Death.</p>
                     <p>If we could dye twice our impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would not be ſo great, we might have ſome hope to repaire our fault, by expiating a wicked Life and an unprepar'd Death together. But we can dye but once, and we know that an Eternity of happineſs or miſery depends on that once.</p>
                     <p>We are not onely bound to live well (ſaith an Eminent ſervant of God) but much more to dye well for the moſt pious Life will avail
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50233:58"/>nothing if it be not follow'd by an holy Death. Have we labour'd for Heaven? have we lead an holy Life? we are ſo much the more concern'd to dye holily that we may not loſe the fruit of our pains. 'Tis true an happy death is the ordinary fruit of an holy Life, but 'tis no leſs true that if we dye ill we loſe all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the moſt Exact Life, and all thoſe merits cannot ſecure us an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Death.</p>
                     <p>Whence comes it then, that we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke no more care to prepare for Death, then if were certain that we should never dye, or that we should dye well, or that we should dye more then once? whence is it that we act as if we could loſe nothing by dying ill, or as if it were a very eaſy thing to dy well?</p>
                     <p>Can we be ignorant of the danger we run, of acquitting our ſelves ill of what we never try'd? eſpecially when we don't know how to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it? Can we be ignorant that it is the hardeſt thing in the world to dye well? that if we deſert our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to a death bed, we put it off
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50233:59"/>to a time that is too uncertain for ſo great à work? The work is long, the time is short, and very improper for a buſineſs ſo extremely nice and delicate; ſo that he who waits for this time ſtay's till he is a dying to prepare himſelfe for Death. We muſt therefore (adds that holy man) prepare our ſelves betimes; We should begin this moment, leaſt if we delay any longer we begin too late; or leaſt the time we shall have then, prove as moſt certainly it will, altogether unfit to prepare to dye in.</p>
                     <p>If a good Death conſiſted only in receiving the laſt Sacraments, in kiſſing a Crucifix, or shedding a few teares, our imprudence would be more tolerable, but how many with all imaginable helps have dy'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably becauſe they never prepar'd for death?</p>
                     <p>He who dyes well, dyes in the ſtate of grace, he dyes truly penitent, which he cannot do unleſs he hates ſin abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve all things in the world, will it be eaſy for a man who has lov'd and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on ſin all his Life and ſtays till death tears him by force from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50233:59"/>of it, will it be eaſy for ſuch a man efficaciouſly to reſolve againſt it? will it be an eaſy thing for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſincere acts of Contrition, of faith, of hope, and Charity, who was never us'd to them? when he is oppreſs'd with pain and ſickneſs, his ſoul troubled and diſorder'd at the approach of Death, will it be an eaſy thing for him to regulate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and his Conſcience too at ſuch a time? to make a general Confeſſion which requires ſo much leiſure, &amp; thereby repair all the faults of his paſt Confeſſions? Is ſuch a man who ſcarce knows what he do's, in a condition to diſpatch in two or three hours the moſt difficult work in the world which requires very much time, a perfect tranquility of mind and the greateſt application?</p>
                     <p>If we imagine it eaſy to dye well and with ſo little preparation, we muſt condemn the Saints who took ſo much pains, who ſpenr Their whole lives in preparation, and yet after all were not free from a ſaving fear at their laſt hour. Nay we muſt condemn our ſelves for acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50233:60"/>that they were truly wiſe in what they did. We own that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too well prepar'd for Death! O why then do we make ſo little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it?</p>
                     <p>Our Redeemer forſaw our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs in this matter, and therefore he has exhorted us more to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration than to any thing elſe.

                     <p>The wiſe men of the world are not ſo negligent in their temporal concerns; do we our ſelves act in the ſame manner? do we undertake any thing of importance, wherein our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, our honour, or our pleaſure is concerned without taking our meaſures before hand? we will not venture to ſpeak in publick or to shew our capacity till we have taken time to prepare our ſelves for it; and with what care and diligence do we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

                     <p>We are afraid that the thoughts of Death will diſturb our joy and make us ſad; we deceive our ſelves, the thoughts of Death diſquiet onely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who are unprepar'd and unwilling to think of it.

                     <p>But we truſt in the grace of God, and thus whe hazard all by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves ſure of Grace, which God without any injuſtice might have refus'd to the moſt perfect Saints, and the ſon of God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that they who deferr their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the laſt <hi>shall dye in their ſins.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. A more particular manner of preparation, and which is moſt ſuit able for this day of Retreat, is to do all the Exerciſes of the Day as if it were the laſt Day of your Life, endeavouring to put your ſelfe into ſuch a diſpoſition as you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be in at the hour of Death.</p>
                     <p>To that end conſider ſeriouſly at the cloſe of each Meditation, what your thoughts on that ſubject would be if you were juſt going to give up an account to God of your whole Life. And particularly examine what it is that would moſt trouble you if you were now a dying.</p>
                     <p>Three things uſually diſturb dying
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50233:64"/>men. 1. Their neglect of the Duty's of their ſtation. 2. Their frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacraments without profit. 3. Their abuſe of the meanes of perfection which they have enjoy'd, &amp; their having, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uſeleſs the inſpirations and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they have receiv'd. We should examine ſtrictly this Day (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially during the meditation on Death) whether we have nothing to reproach our ſelves on theſe heads; how we have hitherto diſcharg'd the duty's of our calling; whether we are punctual and careful now? If we are engag'd in the world, do we live in it like Chriſtians, according to our Saviours maxims? If we have the happineſs to be Religious, are we exact in keeping our vows and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Rule? If we have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be Prieſts, do our Lives anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the holineſs of our Caracter? In what ever ſtation we are, have we done our duty in it? are we ſatisfy'd with our condition? And should we not be ſorry if we were going to dye, that we have made no greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the way of Perfection?</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:50233:64"/>
                     <p>Do not our frequent Confeſſions without any amendment, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated unprofitable Communions fly in our faces? Jeſus Chriſt hath fed us with his precious body and blood, do we grow ſtronger by that Divine food? what should we anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to that impartial judge if we we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re now before him commanded to give an account of his blood? Do we ſay or hear Maſs with that piety &amp; Devotion as becomes a Sacrifice which is the holyeſt act of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Would a Prieſt find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort if he were now to dye in the Remembrance of the ſentiments with which he hath ſo often celebrated? And could he rejoyce before God in having frequently offer'd that adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice?</p>
                     <p>Have we not made an ill uſe of thoſe precious Graces which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer purchas'd for us with his Blood? how many inſpirations have we neglected? how many good deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res have we ſtifled? we muſt give an exact account of all theſe favours, are we ready to do it if we were to dye this moment? Are we able to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50233:65"/>shew that we have improv'd our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents? We know it is not enough to keep them, can we shew that we have augmented them?</p>
                     <p>Theſe should be the heads of our examination at the end of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on Death; we should make our Confeſſion as if it were our laſt, and endeavour to repair what ever we have reaſon to fear has been amiſs in our former. We should do well to make ſome reflections on the ſtate of our affaires, and order them ſo as they may not diſturb us when we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to dye. In short, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to end the Day in ſuch a ſtate as we would deſire to be in the laſt moment, and we muſt cloſe up all with a ſacrifice of our ſelves, our poſſeſſions, our healths, our Lives to Chriſt, begging him to diſpoſe abſolutely of them for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Glory, and ſubmitting our ſelves entirely and freely to Death when ever he pleaſes. We muſt then devote ourſelves wholly to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, &amp; beſeech her to ſtand by us in this difficult time; we muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſome prayers to S. Joſeph, to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50233:65"/>our Guardian Angels who are able to give us very powerful ſuccors, and ſumm up all our deſires with begging the grace of perſeverance in ſome particular prayer as we judge moſt proper:</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third Method is to ſet one Day a part every year to prepare for Death; to conſecrate it entirely to that work, and do that Day what we muſt do when we come to dye, what we shall then wish we had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and what we shall not be able to do upon a Death Bed.</p>
                     <p>The Evening before we muſt put our affairs in ſuch order that we may meet with no interruption next day: for the work of the Day requires an abſolute Retreat and a perfect tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind: if we have conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency we should begin with viſiting the holy Sacrament, beſeeching our our Redeemer by the merits of his Death to give us grace to diſpoſe our ſelves to dye well. Then we should addreſs our ſelves in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the <hi>Bleſsed Virgin,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection is ſo neceſsary in that laſt hour, <hi>to Saint Michael, our good
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50233:66"/>Angels, S. Joſeph</hi> and the <hi>Saint whoſe name we bear;</hi> we should do well to ſay the <hi>Veſpers for the dead,</hi> and ſo cloſe our preparation for the next Day with half an hour of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the improvement of Time, the meanes and Graces which God hath beſtowed on us to work out our ſalvation, and the little pains we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve taken for it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parable</hi> in the <hi>ſixteenth of S.</hi>

                        <hi>Luke</hi> is proper to be the ſubject of the Meditation, where the <hi>Rich man</hi> who was diſatisfy'd with his <hi>ſteward</hi> requires him to <hi>give an account</hi> of his conduct ſince he took the charge of his affaires; or elſe we may chooſe the other <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>barren figtree</hi> which is already propos'd for the evening before the Retreat.

                     </p>
                     <p>We are to ſpend the reſt of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſolitude, retir'd from the noiſe and diſtraction of the world, wholly employ'd in taking care of our ſalvation; in making a general Confeſſion of our whole Lives, or of one or ſo many years as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector thinks fit. And we muſt omit nothing that may ſerve to put our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50233:66"/>ſouls into ſoo good a ſtate that we may have nothing to reproach our ſelves, no ſcrupules concerning our paſt Life; that we may be able to look on the next Day as the laſt of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves &amp; to employ it as we would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the laſt.</p>
                     <p>Let us begin the Day with bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God who hath been pleas'd to give us yet longer time, and to inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire us with the deſign of preparing for Death: And proſtrate before the Crucifix let us offer up our ſelves, our health, our goods, our Lives, an abſolute Sacrifice to God: ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves heartily to whatever kind of Death he thinks fit to ſend, &amp; accepting it in ſatisfaction for our ſins &amp; in union with the Death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Then let us meditate an hour on Death, on what we shall ſuffer, feel, and think then: let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to become ſenſible that it is not farr off; and to put on ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we shall have at its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                     <p>Let us reflect ſeriouſly on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Death, how without any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50233:67"/>exception it deprives us of all things; on the condition of our body's in the grave, and how ſoon we shall be forgotten in the world; how little our Relations, our Friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance will think of us, as if we had never liv'd. Let us affect our ſelves with the vanity of all that charms us here, with the folly of placing our happineſs or our hopes on the Creatures: Riches, honors, pleaſures, all vanish &amp; are as nothing at the ſight of Death; but above all let us preſs home the importance of dying well; the danger of dying ill if we do not prepare for it betimes, and that it will be to little purpoſe for us to put off our preparation to a Death-Bed.</p>
                     <p>This Meditation should produce ſincere reſolutions that we will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately begin to do what when Death comes we shall wish we had done ſooner, and what we shall not be able to de if we deferr it till then. And becauſe external objects very much contribute to render us more recollected, we may follow their Examples who make their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50233:67"/>as obſcure as they can, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the repreſentation of Death before them, leaving onely juſt light enough to diſcern it. Others ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to expire and with a Crucifix in their hands ſeek all their conſolation from that amiable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Others hang their Chamber with mourning and endeavour by the ſight of their winding sheets to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Death approching. Theſe fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral objects have a certain mournful air which is capable of making agreat impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Our Confeſſion muſt bu ſuch as we would make if we were dying; we muſt omitt nothing, we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe nothing that may give us any trouble we muſt lay our ſouls entirely open, that our Confeſſor may be as well acquainted with our interior as we are our ſelves. We muſt shew him all that paſses in our hearts, all that God ſees there, and which he will one day expoſe to all the World if we do not prevent that terrible diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by a full and entire Confeſſion. Hove all we muſt be truly contrite, which is the point wherein we are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50233:68"/>ofteneſt deficient.</p>
                     <p>Say to your ſoul, that you are working for Eternity, tis not a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony you are about; you are now to blot out all your paſt fins, to do this work in ſuch a manner that you may be in no need of doing it again were you immediately to dye.</p>
                     <p>Examine your ſelfe carefully on theſe Articles; the reſtitution of your neighbours goods; the reparation of his honour blaſted by your cenſures; the example you have given; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and ſlothfulneſs of your Life; your Enmity's and hatreds; your want of godly ſorrow, of ſincerity, and of reſolutions of amendment in your Confeſſions; the ſins of your youth; thoſe which your intereſt hath made you commit; the ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in wich you have indulg'd your ſelfe; the dangerous engagements you would not break; the next ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafions of ſin which you would not avoid; the darling paſſion the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſin which men hardly ever mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, &amp; which is the ſource of all their diſorders; your inordinate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50233:68"/>of pleaſure; your wilful ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the duty's of your ſtation; your abuſive and ſcandalous railleries; the ill uſe of the Sacraments, of time, of Grace: If you be Religious ſearch into the violation of your vows, your careleſsneſs indiſcharging the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duty's of your Calling.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the things which do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſturb us on a Death-bed and make our Salvation doubtful; when reſtitution, reparation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to thoſe we have aſpers'd, when quitting the occaſions of ſin, reconciling our ſelves to our Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies precede our Confeſſion, it is the beſt ſign that our ſorrow and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are ſincere.</p>
                     <p>We should look upon this days communion as the Viaticum, and imagine that we hear the Prieſt when he puts the bleſſed Hoſt into our Mouths, ſays,
<note place="margin">Accipe via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, corpus Domini no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri Jeſu Chriſti, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Receive Dear Brether the precious body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt your Saviour, to be your viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> in your paſſage to Eternity. The Acts following the Communion muſt be ſuitable to the condition of a dying Chriſtian, which we shall not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50233:69"/>be able to make when we are indeed expiring.</p>
                     <p>Having regulated our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces let us then put our temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in order, as if we were going to dye.

                     <p>Let the remainder of the Day be employed in good works, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſolitude and recollection, and in reading ſome ſpiritual Book that treats of Death. <hi>Father Colombiere's three diſcourſes</hi> on that ſubject are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and may be very uſeful if we peruſe them carefully: <hi>Or elſe</hi>

                     <p>Let us paſs one hour in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the duty's of our private ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially on thoſe particulars which may trouble us on a Death hed; and we may reap great benefit by being attentive to the prayers of the Church for dying perſons, either in the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of extreme unction, or in the Recommendation of the ſoul to God.</p>
                     <p>It is evident that we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr our ſelves all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation during the whole Day; we muſt ſpeak only to our Director un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we viſit ſome poor ſick or dying perſon, not only to comfort and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them but alſo to raiſe in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a more lively image of what we shall be one day.</p>
                     <p>We muſt cloſe the Day with a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on Judgment; on the different conditions of a fervent and alukewarm ſoul going to appear befor God.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that no buſineſs is of ſo great importance to us as the buſineſs of our ſalvation; an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of happineſs or miſery depends on the ſucceſs of this. All other affaires are only permitted as they are ſubſervient to this great Work: If we loſe this, we loſe all, for we loſe God who is all good; &amp; without whom there can be no good; if we fail in this, he is loſt to us, and loſt for ever without recovery.</p>
                     <p>Salvation is our own buſineſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50233:74"/>every thing elſe is forreign to us; in other things we do the buſineſs of our Children, our Friends, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, our Country, or of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to which we belong, and not preciſely our own buſineſs; every thing elſe is a buſineſs of Time, this of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>If we loſe other buſineſs tho of the higheſt importance we may find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, or if we do not, we shall be no loſers provided we ſucceed in this. The loſs of our ſouls is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreparable loſs, Eternity its ſelfe will not be ſufficient to deplore it.</p>
                     <p>Shall we be able to comfort our ſelves with the thoughts that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been ſucceſs full in all our other buſineſs of no conſequence, and and have only neglected this, which is the only buſineſs of Eternity? 'Tis no matter tho we live obſcurely and forgotten, without friends, or ſupport, and dye poor, provided we ſecure our ſalvation. But what will all our Riches and power, all our knowledge and wiſdom avail us, if we looſe our ſouls? Tho all the world should conſpire together,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50233:74"/>they will never be able to deprive a man of Heaven &amp; make him miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all Eternity: Neither will they be able to make one damn'd ſoul happy,
<note place="margin">Quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt homini ſi univerſum mundum lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretur, &amp;c. <hi>Luc</hi> 6.25.</note> ſo much as mitigate his Torments. What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe his ſoul, or what can he give in exchange for his ſoul?</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that this buſineſs of Eternity is the onely buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence we have to do, and that yet we should neglect this moſt, and lay it leaſt to heart?</p>
                     <p>We fancy that our ſtudies, our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, our diverſions, that our viſits and converſation are of great importance to us, they take up all our time, we can never find leiſure enough for them, we are unwilling to deferr them; but when we should think ſeriouſly of our ſouls, we make no difficulty, of deferring, we imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne it is too ſoon, &amp; that we shall have time enough, and yet (which is ſtill more ſurprizing) we are never at leaſure to ſet about it.</p>
                     <p>Certainly we muſt have odd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eternal happineſs, ſince we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50233:75"/>are ſo carleſs of ſecuring it; would we be content to take no more pains, and ſpend no more time in our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's. and in temporal affaires, then we do in what concerns ous Eternal ſalvation?</p>
                     <p>If our ſalvation depended on a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he have ſo little zeal or charity, as to neglect it more then we do our ſelves? Tho we know it depends wholly on our own care. What pains do's every man take in his calling? If we have a child to provid for, if we have a deſign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn in partnership with a Merchant, how careful are we to inform our ſelves, to examine, to adviſe with our ffriends; what meaſures do we not obſerve; what precautions do we not take? we think we can never be too ſure. But are we to ſpend a little time for ſalvation, we think a very little too much.</p>
                     <p>Salvation is the buſineſs of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but it muſt be done in time; &amp; we have need of all our Time for it; God gives us our whole Life to think of it; he judged it was all little enough, but we imagine it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50233:75"/>may be done inleſs.</p>
                     <p>If we ſpent in working out our ſalvation, the hundredth part of the Time and pains we throw a way in worldy buſineſs, we should ſoon be great ſaints. This is the only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary buſineſs we can have, and yet we hardly allot a little Time for it, nay we grudge it even that little.</p>
                     <p>By our proceedings one would think that we believe God our deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and oblig'd to us for beeing ſaved.</p>
                     <p>If a man of buſineſs or Letters, paſs one whole day in accquitting himſelfe of the duty's of a Chriſtian, he looks upon that day as loſt; But we ſpend whole months in vain ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, or in worldly buſineſs, and call this ſpending the time well.</p>
                     <p>Salvation is our great and chief buſineſs; now a mans chief buſineſs takes up all his thoughts &amp; hardly gives him time to think of any other; &amp; if this ſucceds he comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the miscarriage of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>We commonly put off the care of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50233:76"/>our ſalvation our to our laſt ſickneſs, that is, we put of the buſineſs of Eternity, the moſt important buſineſs we have, and which requires all our Lives, to a time when we are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of following the ſlighteſt buſineſs in the world, when we are indeed in capable of any thing.</p>
                     <p>If God miſtaken? who tells us, this only is of conſequence. Is he deceived in the diſpoſition of his Providence, &amp; in all his care which tends only to this? Is he in whom are all good things, and who is all himſelfe, ſo little to be valued that we can be indifferent whether we loſe him or no? Whence is all that weeping, that cruel deſpair of the damn'd ſouls, if what they have loſt be not worth our ſeeking? If ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery be ſo ſlight a buſineſs, why do we tremble at the thoughts of Eternity? And if we believe it ſo terrible, how can we be at reſt while we are ſo careleſs about it, And in ſo much danger?</p>
                     <p>My God! how many day's of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce have I abus'd? how many precious hours have I let paſs unprofitably?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50233:76"/>Wretch that I am to ſpend ſo much Time in doing nothing: But how much more wretched shall I be, if I do not now at length begin ſeriouſly to work out my ſalvation?</p>
                     <p>What do I ſtay for? For a proper time? Alas! that time perhaps is already paſt for me. Do I ſtay till thou calleſt me? Thou haſt never ceas'd to do it. Oh! how long haſt thou ſollicited me to no purpoſe? shall this reiterated Grace thou giveſt me now be in vain?</p>
                     <p>How long shall I ſpend the beſt part of my Life in vain amuſements which I my ſelfe condemn; And do I condemn them onely to aggravate my guilt, by loſing that time in the purſuit of them which I ought to employ for Heaven?</p>
                     <p>How long shall I fancy thoſe things neceſſary, which are of no uſe for the next Life? whill I neglect only the buſineſs of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>My God how great will my deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and confuſion be upon a Death Bed, if I continue to live as I have done hitherto? when all the meanes and opportunity's I have had of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50233:77"/>my ſalvation, when this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity, and the thoughts I now have of doing it preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to my memory?</p>
                     <p>O my God ſince thou haſt not yet punished me, tho I deſerv'd punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I truſt thou wilt not refuſe me the aſſiſtance of thy Grace, tho I am unworthy of it. Since this is the day deſign'd for my converſion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſolution shall not be like the reſt. I believe, I am fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I am ſenſible that there is but one thing neceſſary, that Eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the onely buſineſs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me, and I am determin'd to begin this Day to apply my ſelfe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to it.</p>

                     <p>God hath ſent us into the world onely to work out our Salvation; this was his ſole deſign in creating us, this is his ſole deſign in preſerving us; will he be ſatisfy'd with our telling him when we come to dye? Lord we have done great things, we have been in great repute in the world, we have got large Eſtates, we have, been inſtrumental in the ſalvation of our neighbours, we have neglected
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50233:78"/>nothing but our own ſavation; we have done every thing but that one thing for which thou haſt ſent us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world. Ad yet this is all the account the greateſt part of mankind is able to give, becauſe 'tis at this rate the greateſt part of mankind live. And if we were now to appear before God, could we give any other account.</p>
                     <p>Is all this true? is there ſuch an Eternity? is Life given us only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it?

                     <p>My God! do we indeed believe this our great buſineſs? the Devils and the damn'd have as good or ſtronger ſpeculative belief then we, but do we reduce our Faith to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, which is the ſcience of the Saints.</p>

                     <p>What are we the better for being endued with Reaſon if we make no uſe of it in the buſineſs of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for which alone God beſtow'd it on us?

                     <p>And (which is yet more ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing) we are all agreed in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of Salvation, and in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of every thingelſe; yet we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves onely to ſeek thoſe vanity's, and are negligent in nothing but the buſineſs of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>We are all conceited of our wiſdom

                     <p>'Tis an affront to tell a man that he do's not underſtand his buſineſs, but 'tis no diſgrace to be accus'd of negligence in the buſineſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſurely we do not look upon it as our buſineſs; My God! when did this one thing neceſſary ceaſe to be ſo?</p>
                     <p>We can looſe our ſouls with all the tranquility in the world, and we are reaſonable Creatures in every thing that do's not concern us; we do not deny that the Saints were truly wiſe, yet all their wisdom conſiſted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50233:80"/>in preferring their Salvation to every thing elſe; in esteeming it their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Are we wiſer them they, that our actions are ſo contrary to theirs? they ſpent their whole lives in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for Eternity; to what end did they take ſo much pains &amp; ſpend ſo much time, for what we pretend to do with ſo much eaſe? Miſerable unthinking wretches that we are to allow ſo little Time for what requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res it all.</p>
                     <p>Have we found a new way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whereof the ſon of God was ignorant? or is the price of Heaven fallen? and is that happineſs which coſt the blood of Chriſt to purchaſe become of leſs value?</p>
                     <p>What are now the ſentiments of thoſe famous ſtates men whom we eſteem the greateſt Politicians? of thoſe extraordinary men who were alway's buſy in pacifying or troubling the world, which their heads wer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes full of. Thoſe men of Riches as the ſcripture calls them who liv'd without thinking on Eternity, and who after an uninterrupted ſucceſs in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50233:80"/>all their other buſineſs, have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarry'd only, in this great buſineſs of Salvation? They are not damn'd for lazineſs and ſloth, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ow their ruine to too much uſeleſs buſineſs; they were ſo buſy that their very ſleeps were broken by their Cares, and they have loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by labouring in what did not concern them, by taking too much pains about nothing while they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected their onely real buſineſs, And 'tis by this that the greateſt part of mankind are loſt.</p>

Having made us free and maſters of our ſelves, what pains hath he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, what pains doth he ſtill take to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50233:81"/>gain our hearts? He deſires our hearts, he ſollicites us to give them, he is importunate with us for them; ſome times he promiſes, ſome times he threatens, he leaves nothing undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to perſuade us to love him; he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes all this pains becauſe he knows it is in our power to ſave or damn our ſelves, and he earneſtly deſires our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Did we ever duly conſider, are we able to comprehend the miſtery of our Redemption? where the Almighty exerts all his omnipotence to shew the greatneſs of his Love to our ſouls, and with what earneſtneſs he deſires our ſalvation? Could we ever have imagin'd that God should become man to the end that men might be ſaved? Yet this he hath done, and not content with this wondrous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, he goes yet farther to engage us to love him; he paſſes a Life of three and thirty years in poverty and ſufferings, and he ſubjects himſelfe to a cruel Death. Such a value doth God ſet upon our ſouls that nothing leſs than the ſufferings, the blood, the Life of this God and man could
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50233:82"/>redeem them; and shall we think it a small matter to looſe them?</p>
                     <p>Shall we think that we do too much when God thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much to purchaſe our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? Let us rather conclude that we can never do enough. What does he get by our Salvation? yet what could he do more then he hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne? Is not all the profit ours? why then do we do ſo little for it?</p>
                     <p>How many are now raging and deſpairing for having negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to do what I may do if I will? and which if I neglect now, I shall one day feel the ſame regrett as they. Can we have a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motive to excite us to ſet about it without delay and to purſue it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually?</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed be God we may yet work out our Salvation; we have yet ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; God offers us his Grace; theſe very thoughts proceed from that Grace; but this may perhaps be the laſt moment wherein it will be offer'd us. Our Eternal happineſs for ought we know, our Predeſtination may depend on this one important mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50233:82"/>I am certain that I may make my Salvation ſure at preſent if I turn ſincerely and heartily to God; I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve at leaſt great reaſon to doubt that if I let ſlip this occaſion I shall never have a nother, and can I wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr one moment?</p>
                     <p>Shall the Devil take more pains to deſtroy our ſouls then we will take to preſerve them? shall he value our ſouls at an higher rate then we do our ſelves? The compariſon is shameful but too true: tho his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re be much nobler then ours, and his pride ſo great, yet he ſtoops to any thing that can ruine a ſoul: he never gives over, the greateſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance never weary's him, or renders him leſs diligent in aſsaulting us; he cunningly makes uſe of every little occaſion to deſtroy us. Good God! muſt we learn of him how to prize our ſouls? and do we ſtand in need of his Example to excite us ſeriouſly to work out our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>Is nor all that thou haſt done ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? muſt we ſearch for new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince us of the worth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50233:83"/>of a ſoul for which thou haſt paid ſo ſo great a price? Thou haſt redeemed me o Divine Saviour, I am thine by a double title, and am reſolv'd that nothing in the world shall hinder my giving my ſelfe wholly to thee without reſerve.</p>

                     <p>If we have the honour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the immediate ſervice of God, let us call to mind all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our vocation, and we shall find them ſo many miracles of Providence; that we should come to ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch company; that when we thought our ſelves moſt wedded to the world we found our ſelves on a ſudden weaned from it, that the numerous examples of worldings did not allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re us, nor the love of our Friends retain us; that we were not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by the auſterity's of a life which appeard so terrible, but that we had reſolution enough to ſurmount all rheſe obſtacles.</p>
                     <p>Nothing but grace could inſpire this generous reſolution to a perſon weary of the world, tir'd out with Croſse and terrify'd with the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts of approaching Death: but in

                     <p>But whence proceed theſe pious ſentiments at a time when I deſerve them ſo little? whence is it that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many who would have been better then I, God hath inſpir'd me only with this thought? And if others have entertain'd the ſame ſincere deſires, &amp; have had much greater merits, whence is it that they are not choſen? how comes it that if they were choſen they did not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere? that God perhaps hath ſuffer'd them to fall back that I might take their place?</p>
                     <p>Add to theſe diſtinguishing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all the inſpirations and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſiſtances with which he prevents us daily, and if all theſe viſible proofs of his ſingular care of us do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us to love and ſerve him without any reſerve, we muſt be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50233:85"/>certainly the moſt ungrateful wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches living, and deſerve the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt immediate vengean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are great ſubjects of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which require frequent and ſerious reflexions, they are the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects of Gods particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which continually watches over us. They are the viſible marks of his ſingular Love in preferring us to ſo many others; and nothing is ſo capable of exciting in us a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, a firm confidence, an invincible reſolution, and ardent Love to him. And yet perhaps the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re are ſome who never thought of it.</p>
                     <p>My God! how do we employ our thoughts? How can we neglect the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe comfortable &amp; important Truths? ſurely it would be impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay ſetting about the great work of Salvation, if we did ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on what God hath done, and continues to do every day for us.</p>
                     <p>No wonder the Devil employs all his cunning to prevent our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50233:85"/>on theſe things; he knows how very proper they are to inſpire a ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re deſire of ſerving God; but we are inexcuſable to paſs ſo ſlightly over, and be ſo little affected with theſe preſſing motives to endeavour after perfection in our ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine whether we have faithfully concurr'd with the Grace of God, and whether we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his deſigns in taking ſo much care of our Salvation; Let us examine wherein we have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, and penetrated with this wonderful goodneſs of God who is ſo deſirous to make us Saints, let us deferr no longer, let us immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely correſpond with his will who ſeeks our good, and reſolve on ſuch meaſures as will make our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions effectual. Then we shall reap the fruit of this meditation and of this Day's retreat, if we be careful to purſue our Reſolutions, and not ſuffer them to be as ſo many have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been, without effect.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that then umber of thoſe who shall be ſaved is very small not only in compariſon of above two thirds of mankind who live in infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but even in compariſon of that vaſt multitude who are loſt in the true Religion. There are few doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of our Faith more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd than this, Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate (ſaith our Saviour) for wide is the Gate and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50233:87"/>many there be that go in thereat, but ſtrait is the Gate &amp; narrow is the way that leadeth to Life, and few there be that find it.</p>
                     <p>And in another place he tells us that many are called but few are choſen even of thoſe that are called; which he repeats in the ſame terms on another occaſion: And the Apoſtle ſpeaking by the ſpirit of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Body of Chriſtians to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe who run a race where many run but one onely gains the prize, to whom he likens thoſe that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And to let us ſee that he ſpeaks of Beleevers he cites the example of the Iſraelites, you know my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (ſay's he) that our Fathers were all under a cloud, &amp; all paſſed through the Red ſea with Moſes, that they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat: all theſe miracles were wrought onely for their ſafe paſſage to the promis'd Land, yet how few of them arriv'd in it? of eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſouls that came out of Egypt, none but Ioshuah and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb entred into Canaan.</p>
                     <p>Iſaiah compares the Elect to thoſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50233:87"/>few Olives that are left here and there upon the Trees after the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and to that small number of grapes that remain after the diligent gleaning of the Vineyard.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe examples and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons which the ſcripture uſes to convince us of this terrible Truth, we have the examples of all the world: there was but one family preſerv'd from the deluge; of five great city's onely four perſons were ſaved from deſtruction, and we find but one ſick man cur'd of the palſey among the crowd of Paralyticks that flock'd to the pool of Bethesda: This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truth which our Lord repeated ſo of ten to his diſciples gave occaſion to that queſtion, Lord are there few that shall be ſaved? To which our Saviour waving the Queſtion leaſt he should terrify them, anſwers, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to enter in at the ſtrait Gate.</p>
                     <p>This is certainly the moſt awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and terrible Doctrine of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp; yet how little are we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it?</p>
                     <p>Were I ſure that but one of ten thouſand should be damn'd, I ought
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50233:88"/>to fear and tremble leaſt it should be my caſe; but alas! among ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perhaps there will hardly be one ſav'd, and yet I am unconcern'd and and fear nothing. Is not my ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a ſufficient cauſe to fear? Do's it not proceed from the blindneſs and hardneſs of my heart? which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me inſenſible of my danger, and thereby leſs capable of preventing or avoiding it.</p>
                     <p>The news of one ship loſt among ten thouſand affrights many, every one that has concerns at ſea appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends for himſelfe; but though we know that the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind shall be loſt, that very few will arrive at the Port of eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how little are we ſollicitous for our ſelves? and who has told us that we shall arrive there?</p>
                     <p>If Jeſus-Chriſt had promis'd hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all Chriſtians as poſitively as he has declared that his Elect are but few we could not be more unconcern'd then we are. But do's this ſecurity leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen our danger? And will this inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blity render us leſs miſerable? Alas! if we had no other, this very tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50233:88"/>is a ſufficient cauſe to make us doubt of our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>We don't think of it; what is it employs our thoughts if Eternity do's not? Do we believe it; can we believe it and not fear it? and how can we fear it without thinking of it?</p>
                     <p>How can we be unconcern'd at the ſight of ſo great a danger? the greateſt Saints were alwayes afraid; Saint Paul himſelfe was never exempt from this ſaving fear, yet we are free from it; for it is impoſſible to fear truly and not mend our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</p>
                     <p>We Sacrifice our goods to preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve our ſelves from shipwrack; a marchant makes no difficulty to throw his moſt precious wares the fruits of many yeares labour overbord, to ſave himſelfe; but we will rather hazard all than part with any thing to ſecure us from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>If the infection be in the City every body is afraid; with what earneſtneſs do we ſeek preſervatives? with what care do we shun the beſt companys &amp; condemn our ſelves to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50233:89"/>ſolitude? and all this becauſe we are afraid to dye. Are we not afraid of being damnd? we believe that the greateſt part of the world will be loſt, and yet we are unwilling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpare one day for retreat, we will do nothing to make ſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>Do we rely upon our vocation, upon the ſanctity of our condition, upon the talents God hath given us, or upon the meanes of ſalvation which he affords us? Alas! remember Saul had a true vocation to the Kingdom, Judas to the dignity of an Apoſtle, yet Saul was rejected and Judas loſt even in Chriſts family. Solomon the wiſeſt of men hath with all his knowledge left us in doubt of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and an infinite number of Chriſtian Hero's who were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary for their Piety during the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of their Lives, have fallen at laſt. Their too much ſecurity hath ruin'd them in the end of their Lives, and they are damn'd with all their pretended merits.</p>
                     <p>And yet O my God can I be without fear? This want of ſaving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50233:89"/>fear should make me fear all things; I am certainly loſt if I be not afraid of being loſt, and can I fear any thing ſo much as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition?</p>
                     <p>O my Dear Saviour who haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me with thy precious blood, and who art graciouſly pleas'd to make me ſenſible of my danger, ſuffer me not to be loſt for ever. My God! let me not be found among the Reprobates. I confeſs that I have hitherto walk'd in the broad way, but behold O Lord, I will now go into the narrow way and will ſtrive with all my might to enter into the ſtreight Gate.</p>
                     <p>Let others run in crowds to Hell, were there to be but one ſav'd in this place I am reſolv'd to be he; and I depend on thy grace; I know it is my own fault if I be not one of thy Elect. I have abus'd thy former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but I have ground to hope that this shall be effectual: for I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd let the number of the Elect be never ſo small I will be one of that little flock whatever it coſt me; And I am perſuaded it is thy will as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50233:90"/>well as mine ſince I could not form this reſolution if thou hadſt not inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> that if our Faith did not reach us this terrible truth our own Reaſon would convince us of it; we need onely reflect on what is requir'd of us, and on our manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, and we shall preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there will be but few ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>If we would be ſaved we muſt live up to the Rules of the Goſpel; are there many that obſerve them? we muſt profeſs our ſelves open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be followers of Chriſt; is not the great eſt part of man kind asham'd of that profeſſion? if we would be ſav'd we muſt either actually or in affection renounce the world and all we have in it, and bear our Saviours Croſs daily.</p>
                     <p>The Phariſees had all the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Piety, they were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortified, and their Lives were unblamable in the ſight of men; and yet if our virtue be not more ſolid
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50233:90"/>and more perfect than theirs, we shall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>'Tis agreat matter to ſtiffle our revenge, it is yet greater to for give injury's, but this is not ſufficient to obtain Salvation; if we would be ſaved we muſt love even thoſe who perſecute us. It is not enough to abhorr allwicked actions, we muſt abhorr the leaſt ill thought; we are not onely oblig'd not to covet our neighbours goods, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow our own on thoſe who are in want. True humility which is the eſſential Caracter of a Chriſtian will not admit of ambition or vanity; Tho you labour never ſo much, if God be not indeed the end of your labour, you will have no thanks for your pains to all Eternity. Be as regular as you pleaſe, God is not content with an outward shew; he requires the heart and that you should ſerve him in ſpirit and in Truth; that is ſincerely and uprightly. One mortal ſin effaces in a moment all the merits of the longeſt and beſt Life; and one hundred thouſand millions
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50233:91"/>of years in Hell will not be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient punishment for the ſin of one moment?</p>
                     <p>It is an article of Faith that neither the proud, the covetous, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, the ſlanderer, nor the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt shall ever enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; he that enters the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re muſt either have alwayes preſerv'd his Innocence, or recover'd it by a ſincere repentance; and do we find many who offer continual violence to their inclination, without which we can never come there? where is that exact purity? where is that continual penance? that hatred of ſin? and that ardent charity which is the caractere of the Elect? what is become of the Primitive ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? do's not intereſt govern? and is not Religion it ſelfe made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it? is not the General example the Rule of moſt mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? who look upon it as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime that we muſt act like men while we live among men; but we muſt act like Chriſtians if we will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: we muſt lead a Chriſtian life in the midſt of thoſe who have onely the name.</p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:50233:91"/>
                     <p>'Tis likewiſe certain that the work of ſalvation is our greateſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nèſs; that we are ſent into the world for this end alone; that we muſt employ our whole Lives in it, and that after all we cannot be ſure of it; yet how few Chriſtians do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make this their great &amp; onely buſineſs?</p>
                     <p>We can never be ſav'd without 'fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grace, 'tis an article of our Faith that we can never merit that Grace, that God might without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice refuſe it to the moſt perfect Saints; what reaſon then have we to expect it, who are ſo imperfect and ſo lukewarm in the ſervice of God?</p>
                     <p>Theſe are not counſels onely, they are the maximes of Jeſus-Chriſt; the irrevocable Laws and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable conditions of ſalvation, which is not promis'd to the knowledge but to the obſervation of them; to ſo exact an obſervation, that the neglect of any one damns us to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Let us now call to mind at what a rate men live, and then jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge whether many can be ſaved. Let
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50233:92"/>us examine our ſelves and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have any reaſon to hope to be of that little number.</p>
                     <p>Hear what S. Chryſoſtom ſays to the great City of Conſtantinople; how many (ſay's he) do you think will be ſav'd out of this vaſt City? (one of the greateſt &amp; moſt populous in the world) I shall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify you by my anſwer and yet I am bound to tell you that of ſo many thouſand inhabitants, there will hardly be one hundred ſaved, nay I doubt even of the ſalvation of theſe.</p>
                     <p>And yet this Imperial City was then as well regulated as any of thoſe wherein we live, full of thoſe we call honeſt men; its inhabitants were reputed devout, frequented the Sacraments, and liv'd as we generally do: Let this great Saints deciſion, who would never have ſpoken ſo poſitively without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary light, give us an Idea of the ſmal number of the Elect.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that we can cheat our ſelves ſo groſsly as not to ſee that we are running headlong to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50233:92"/>damnation? and that if we continue to live at our uſual rate, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion obliges us to believe we shall be damn'd?</p>
                     <p>And certainly we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Religion true, if after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid down ſuch ſtrict Rules it allow'd us to hope to be ſav'd in the violation of them; this would be to impoſe upon the world: but bleſſed be God our Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns moſt ſeverely ſuch an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conduct, and careleſs looſe Chriſtians will not be excuſ'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their great number.</p>
                     <p>It is an Article of Faith that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we be like our Redeemer we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannot be ſaved; to be like him we muſt conform our wills, we muſt hate what he hates, &amp; love what he loves: Are there many who reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble this great pattern? how little do we our ſelves reſemble him? and what wil be come of us if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo unlike him?</p>
                     <p>Now adays men content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome outward appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion, with a shew of virtue; every man makes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50233:93"/>a falſe ſyſteme of Conſcience, with which he reſts ſatisfyed as to what concerns his Salvation; yet we believe that Heretiks are loſt who have their ſyſtem's too &amp; who are as exact obſervers of the external part of Religion as we and have very often all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's of meer honeſt men: what ground have we for this imaginary aſſurance? have we any new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or particular Goſpell? Do we build our hopes upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true Faith which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks have not? ſurely unleſs we take pleaſure to deceive our ſelves we muſt own that he who believes little of what he ought to do, is in a much better condition, than the man who do's little or nothing of what he believes.</p>
                     <p>If believing were ſufficient the number of the Predeſtinated would not be ſmall, if we had liberty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live as we pleas'd we should make no difficulty of believing any thing; but Faith without works is dead; though you believe never ſo wel, you can never hope Salvation if you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50233:93"/>neglect to practiſe what you believe. The Devils believe more than we, but their Faith is onely ſpeculative; and woe be to us if ours be no more than ſpeculative.</p>
                     <p>Are The ſublime Sanctity — of our Holy Religion, the admirable example of the Son of God, the shedding of his blood, the efficacy of the Sacraments, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Grace, deſign'd onely to make us keep ſome meaſures, which ſerve onely to encourage us to ſin more boldly by diſguiſing thoſe faults which are common to us with the Pagans? Were the Saints men of another condition than we are? we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they excepted in the univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind? was not the way to Heaven diſcover'd in their Time? did they expect any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe? how comes it that we are ſo very unlike them? they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be Saints, what do we reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to be? And can we hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be Saints without following their Example? what grounds have we to rely on the mercy of God, when we make uſe of that mercy to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50233:94"/>our Converſion? Jeſus-Chriſt has expreſsly condemn'd lukewarm ſouls, yet do's not this tepidity reign among Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>Am I convinc'd that the number of the Elect is ſo ſmall? and shall I do nothing to be of that number? Yes, my God! were there to be but one ſoul ſaved, ſince it depends on my will to be that ſoul, I am reſolv'd to be ſav'd.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge that I have done nothing for thy ſervice which can make me hope, but my confidence is founded on what thou art doing now for me.</p>
                     <p>Thy deſign in giving me this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, &amp; in exciting me to this reſolution, was not to increaſe my guilt: I have no need of any other Argument to convince me that thou deſireſt my Salvation than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this very fear which thou haſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my ſoul leaſt I should not be of the number of thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>

                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that all the calamity's and miſery's that are in the world or have been ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceed from mortal ſin: this is the cauſe of warrs, plagues and Famines, of the deſtruction of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's by fire, and of men by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Eternal Damnation and Hell
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50233:95"/>it ſelfe are the diſmall effects of one Mortal ſin.</p>
                     <p>How can we comprehend the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of mortall ſin? ſeeing thô the Angels were the moſt perfect part of the Creation, neither the nobleneſs of their nature, nor all their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor their fitneſs to glorify their maker to all Eternity, nor their being particularly deſign'd for that end, could exempt them from being plung'd into everlaſting flames, for one mortall ſin of a moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in a vain thought.</p>
                     <p>For one act of diſobedience Adam was depriv'd of his original juſtice, of all his natural and ſupernatural gifts; by this one ſin he loſt the priviledge of immortality, became ſubject himſelfe, and ſubjected his Poſterity to thoſe innumerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery's under which wegroan: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand yeares are paſt, and the Divine vengeance is not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd, nor will be till the end of Ages; 'tis the fire of this wrath that burns in Hell, and will never be extinguish'd.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of the terrible
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50233:95"/>punishment inflicted on mortal ſin is a clear proof that it is the greateſt of evils, ſince God who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs its ſelfe, and whoſe mercy is exalted above all his works is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſevere againſt one act of it.</p>
                     <p>How many perſons eminent for virtue full of merits and arrived to a great degree of ſanctity, are now damn'd for one mortal ſin?</p>
                     <p>If after three or fourſcore years of penance after a long Life ſpent in the exerciſe of the moſt heroick virtues, after having wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; if we commit one mortall ſin, all our penance, all our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues will be counted for nothing, we become Enemys to God, and objects of his wrath &amp; vengeance.</p>
                     <p>By the ſeverity of the punishment we may conceive ſome Idea of the crime, but its enormity, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which God bears to it are more viſible, in the pains he hath taken, and what it hath coſt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. Thoſe inconcevable miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's of the incarnation, the nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Life; the paſſion, and the Death of the Eternal Son were
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50233:96"/>wrought onely for the deſtruction of ſin: nothing leſs then all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood of Chriſt could redeem one ſoul and after all this ſoul shall be damni'd for one mortal ſin: all the flames of Hell, thoſe Eternal fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes could never cleanſe the leaſt ſinful ſpot.</p>
                     <p>Can we believe this and live one moment in ſin? and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this extreme danger continue to ſin and to expoſe our ſelves every day to the occaſions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it? this is hardly to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd.</p>
                     <p>How shall we reconcile our Faith with our practiſe? how shall we make our practiſe and our Reaſon agree? we refuſe no pains to oblige a friend, we are wonderfully exact in every punctilio of good breeding, but ſtupidly careleſs in the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty's of a Chriſtian Life. We own that moſt afflictions are the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of our ſins; we are all afraid of Hell, yet we are not afraid of ſin which is the cauſe of Hell; how ſenſible are we of the smalleſt loſs? how uneaſy, how ſad? and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50233:96"/>often uncapable of comfort? yet how inſenſible of the greateſt? of that irreparable loſs which a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of worlds can never repair: we ſin but we are not ſad, neither do we ſtand in need of comfort.</p>
                     <p>Thô we had committed but one mortal ſin in all our Lives it would be a juſt reaſon for continual humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; it would be a juſt ſubject of fear and trembling to the laſt moment of our Lives. We have ſin'd, we are in danger of renewing our ſins, we are uncertain of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, how can we be without fear?</p>
                     <p>Are we ſure that we are in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of Grace? or do we hope ſo, be cauſe of our reiterated confeſſions? Alas! who hath told us that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition was ſincere? that our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was from a ſupernatural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve? how can we be ſatisfy'd with our purpoſes and reſolutions when we know by experience and by ſo many relapſes how ineffectual they have often been?</p>
                     <p>Since God ſpared not the Angels that ſin'd how ought we to tremble who have ſin'd after the knowledge
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50233:97"/>of their terrible punishment? After having ſeen the ſon of God expire on a Croſs to deſtroy ſin, can I imagine that God will hate ſin leſs in me!</p>
                     <p>My God, &amp; Sauiour! who haſt dyed for me which thou wouldſt not do for the fallen Angels; I humbly beſeech thee by the merits of thy Death to give me that Grace which thou wouldſt not offer them: Give me an hearty ſorrow for all my ſins, and incline my will to anſwer thy End in affording me this time for repentance which thou haſt not given many others, and to begin immediately.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> that venial Sins ſeem ſmall onely to thoſe who have little faith and leſs Love; they who love God truly look upon all ſin with horror, and are more afraid of it than of the greareſt miſery. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin is indeed a ſmall ſin, but it is not a ſmall evil: as long as it is a ſin it is agreater evil than a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſolation of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50233:97"/>and therefore the Saints of God have always judg'd yt all the creatures ought to think themſelves happy if they could prevent one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin by the ſacrifice of their very beings.</p>
                     <p>Moſes his diſtruſt in ſtriking the Rock twice coſt him his Life: Five and twenty thouſand Iſraelites dyed in one day at Berhshemeth for looking too curiouſly into the Ark of God: Davids vanity in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people brought a terrible Plague upon them: two and forty children were devoured by wild Bears for mocking the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha; and Hezekiahis oſtentation in shewing his treaſures to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Babylon could not be expiated by leſs than the loſs of thoſe treaſures.</p>
                     <p>Thus God whoſe wiſdom is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite punishes venial ſins in this Li-Life; but in the next where his juſtice is not reſtrained by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the punishments of venial ſins yield in nothing as to their violence to the torments of Hell, and this he inflicts even on thoſe ſouls
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50233:98"/>whom he loves tenderly and who love him above all things.</p>
                     <p>We shall find one Day that the Death of our beloved Child, the loſs of ſuch an eſtate, ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, the ruine of ſuch a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and publick calamity's are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps now as formerly the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of venial Sins. God indeed doth not alway's ſend viſible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, but then he reſerves the ſinner for ſeverer ſtrokes.</p>
                     <p>For every venial ſin we delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely committ God withdraws ſome portion of his Grace, and is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Grace a ſmall loſs? Veniall Sins do not indeed make God hate us, but they make him love us leſs; they make him ſtop the courſe of his bounty, withold his Graces, and ſuſpend that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Providence with which he watches over thoſe he loves, &amp; that tender care whereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them from danger, whereby he either keeps them from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or enables them to overcome them: Venial Sins render a ſoul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing and inſenſibly diſguſt it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50233:98"/>with Piety, till they have brought it into a lukerwarm diſpoſition, the moſt dangerous ſtate a ſoul can be in. And God at length grows weary of our ingratitude, and cannot ſuffer that we should believe that we au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit our ſelves ſufficiently of the infinite obligations we have to him, provided we abſtain from offring him the moſt outragious affronts, thô at the ſame time we indulge our ſelves in diſpleaſing him every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour.</p>
                     <p>Which of us would have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to keep a ſervant onely for his honeſty, who had no other good quality, who did every thing with reluctancy and by halves, who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us with diſrepect and who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took care to pleaſe us, under pretenſe that it was in things of no conſequence? And can we expect that God should ſuffer a ſervant whom we would not endure? It is true that venial Sins do not render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Enemy's to God; but it is as true that he who indulges himſelfe deliberately in many venial Sins do's not love God.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50233:99"/>
                     <p>Certainly the man that contents himſelfe with barely not being Gods Enemy, eſteems his Love but little; the beſt that can be ſaid is that he is afraid to have God his Enemy; but very indifferent in deſiring him for his Friend. The wilful diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Friend upon all occaſions is a ſtrange method to make him lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve us: And I cannot ſee how we shall be able to reconcile our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of loving with our practiſe of wilfully diſpleaſing him.</p>
                     <p>'Tis no excuſe that we offend onely in little things, their ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs renders us inexcuſable, becauſe we might more eaſily avoid them. If they be little things we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we were diſcourag'd by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or that the violence of our paſſions hurry'd us away, it proceds onely from an indifferency for God whom we ſerve out of fear, and flatter our ſelves that we love him becauſe we dread his juſtice.</p>
                     <p>No wonder then if God be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different for us, if he abhorr our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeneſs, if he withdraw his favours from ſuch unworthy wretches, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50233:99"/>refuſe to communicate him ſelfe any more to us. And indeed we can not expect thoſe peculiar favours which he beſtow's onely on fervent ſouls. Thus we run our ſelves into danger of comitting greater faults, for an habit of venial ſins is the high Road to mortall ones; and God is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner oblig'd to deprive us of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe divine lights, of thoſe ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning graces without which we can never reſiſt violent Temptations. Hence proceed the ſurpriſing falls of many who were at firſt ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; they began by allowing themſelves little Liberty's, and ſo by degrees fell into ſuch diſorders as before this unfaithfulneſs they would have trembled to think of He who deſpiſes little things will moſt certainly fall by degrees: For though venial ſins can never be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me mortall yet they diſpoſe us for them: if we once content our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves with not loſing the Grace of God, we are ſure to looſe it in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Time: theſe terrible falls ſtartle us, but if we did wel conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpoſition in which venial
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50233:100"/>Sins put the ſoul, we should be Ieſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſurpris'd.</p>
                     <p>Venial Sins are like the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a ſickneſs the firſt indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſeems nothing at all, and we think it wil eaſily be cur'd, yet by little &amp; little it undermines our health ſo that the leaſt exceſs or unwholſome ayr throws us in to a malignant feavour and from thence in to the Grave.</p>
                     <p>Though ſometimes men dye ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, yet their Deaths are uſually preceded by ſome light indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſeem'd of no conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Thus Venial Sins thô never ſo deliberate and numerous, do not kill the ſoul but they weaken it, and impair its ſtrength, ſo that it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes and do's its duty's but by halves, and with reluctancy; every thing hurts it, Sacraments, Good works do it no good. How can a ſoul in this condition remain long in a ſtate of Grace being thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſo many impending dangers, depriv'd of its ſupport and ſtrength, &amp; every moment running its ſelfe farther in to danger.</p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:50233:100"/>
                     <p>This made an Eminent Saint ſay that we ought ſome times to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re careful to avoid ſmall ſins than great ones: And 'tis the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of not ſtopping here, 'tis the fear of being depriv'd of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thning grace in punishment of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe little infidelity's, &amp; there by being left a prey to temptation, that makes the Saints ſo incapable of comfort after a veniai Sin.</p>
                     <p>After all, is a Venial Sin no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? is it of no conſequence? what then shal we count ſomething, if it be nothing to offend God? we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think it a matter of conſequence not to diſoblige a friend, we think it a matter of conſequence not to be rude to any man ſo much as by miſtake and shall we think it a ſlight thing deliberately to diſpleaſe God? shall we think it nothing to leſſen his kindneſs to us? to ſtop the channel of his Graces? to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the fervour of charity &amp; to render all the Sacraments of no uſe shall we think our ſelves affronted by a rash word, &amp; shall we think that fault little which offends God?
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50233:101"/>which draws his indifference on us thô not his hatred? which will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke us looſe thoſe ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are worth more than all the riches in the world? shall we make nothing of diſpoſing our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to fall in to mortal Sin, &amp; of indulging our ſelves in thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity's which are often the ginning of the Reprobation of many who appear'd eminent for Piety?</p>
                     <p>Conſider what are our thoughts of venial Sins? have we fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in all our confeſſions to mend them? for it is much to be feard that by frequent confeſſing the ſame venial Sins we too often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our confeſſions at beſt uſeleſs for want of contrition. Let us no longer look upon them as little things, there are but few things that we ought to fear ſo much; Let us examine our ſelves ſtrictly, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly regulate our practiſe.</p>

                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who has not ſome time or other deſir'd to turn ſincerely to God; there are certain happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein by an inward light we diſcover on a ſudden ſo many faults in Creatures, we find ſo little ſolidity in every thing on the earrh, and are ſo diſguſted with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50233:102"/>what ſeem'd moſt charming, that we cannot avoid confeſſing that to neglect the ſervice of God is the higheſt degree of madneſs.</p>
                     <p>Our Reaſon is convinc'd but our paſſions are too ſtrong, and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have not reſolution enough to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; there fore ſelf-Love finds an expedient to flatter both; it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy's our Reaſon by perſuading us to reſolve on Converſion, and pleaſes our ſloth by engaging us to deferr it and to retain our former habits, but here it apparentiy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us for this delay puts us in to an evident danger of never being convetted.</p>
                     <p>Time, Grace, and a willing mind are neceſſary to Converſiow; if we put it off but for one day, how can we promiſe our ſelves that one day? if we have that Day, are we ſure that we shall be more willing to improve it? And who hath told us that we shall then be aſſiſted with amore efficacious graee than that which we have hitherto reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted?</p>
                     <p>Is any thing more uncertain than
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50233:103"/>Time? how many have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd by Death while they were deliberating? And would it not be a diſmall thing to dye full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for a future Converſion?</p>
                     <p>We think it is not now a fit Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to quit our dangerous converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to avoid the occaſions of ſin, to reform our Lives and to live more retir'd &amp; more like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: alas! what time would we have? we are for ſtaying till the heat of youth is paſt, till age and experience have diſabus'd us 'as to thoſe triffles which take us up now, and then every thing will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our converſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind argue about their projects of converſion, for no man pretends to dye unconverted, but do they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well? do we find many of theſe Reſolvers converted before they dye? We accept (ſaith S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin) their pennance who deferr their converſion to the end of their Lives, but we make no great account of ſuch converſions. No my Brethren (adds that great Saint)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50233:103"/>I dare not deceive you and therefore muſt declare that we make no great account of them.</p>
                     <p>We refuſe to be converted now, what grounds have we to believe that we shall be more willing here after? If we find difficulties now, we shall meet with greater then they increaſe with our paſſions, which will then, be ſtronger, and inſtead of youth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful amuſements which take up our Time now, we shall then find that multitude of buſineſs will be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hindrance. Do not flatter your ſelves that you may be converted at any time; who has told you that you shall at all times be capable of converſion? If we refuſe to be converted when God invites us now when our ill habits are but weak &amp; few, can we reaſonably expect to be able to do it here after, when they are multiply'd and grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate? God will be weary of waiting; his ſollicitations will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish as our reſiſtance of his Grace encreaſes; ſo that we are forc'd to own that we run the greateſt hazard in the woild by delaying, and yet
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50233:104"/>we are not a fraid to venture.</p>
                     <p>Was it ever heard that a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne'd malefactor was unwilling to receive his pardon, &amp; deſir'd it might be deferr'd to another Time? God offers us his Friendship, he tenders his pardon to us, and we are unwilling to have it yet; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to ſtay till we are in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to receive it. He ſollicites us and we bid him keep his Love for another Time; would we treat the laſt of men thus, and how should we reſent this uſage our ſelves?</p>
                     <p>Every man promiſes him ſelfe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for Converſion if Jeſus-Chriſt had promis'd us with an Oath that we should have notice of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, we could not live in greater ſecurity than we do, thô we know that he hath ſworn the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>Did ever any Merchand when he had found an opportunty of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all his loſſes put it off to another Time? and deferr the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his fortune till the next day? Would not we think a man diſtracted who being dangerouſly ſick should
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50233:104"/>deſire his Phyſician not to viſit him till five ot ſix Day hence?</p>
                     <p>Am not I with all my preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to wiſdom this diſtracted man, when I delay my Converſion one Day? I am out of favour with God, my ſoul is dangerouſly ill, the moſt efficacious remedy's do me no Good, my ſickneſs encreaſes, God ſollicites and beſeeches me to be cur'd, he deſires onely my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and I refuſe his offer.</p>
                     <p>Has not the Son of God preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all our excuſes and all our falſe pretences by declaring that he will come when we are not aware of him? this is not only the Counſell of a wiſe and knowing friend, it is the deciſion of the Lord of Life and Death who knows the time in which he deſigns to call us. Let our deſigns and projects be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well laid, Death will come when we leaſt expect it.</p>
                     <p>Did we ever ſee a man dye, were we ever dangerouſly ill our ſelves without reſolving to turn to God? and yet we are ſtill uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Our laſt ſickneſs will put
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50233:105"/>us on the ſame reſolutions, but how can we be ſure they will be more ſincere than the former, and why should we think that God will accept them?</p>
                     <p>Men tremble when they find themſelves in danger of loſing their Lives or Eſtates; is it nothing to looſe our ſouls by remaining un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>converted? If the loſs of a ſoul be ſo ſmall a matter why did Jeſus-Chriſt do and ſuffer ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it?</p>
                     <p>My God! thou deſireſt not the Death of a ſinner, thou deſireſt his Converſion; ſo that it is my own fault if I be not converted. Am I unwilling? and how can I pretend to be willing if I put it off from day to day?</p>
                     <p>One would think it were a great misfortune to be wholly thine, ſince men give themſelves to the, as late as they can; I am terrifyed by other dangers, is not this of being loſt for ever a much greater danger?</p>
                     <p>It is reſolv'd O my God! it is reſolv'd, I will deferr no longer; but thô I am willing; it is thou
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50233:105"/>alone that muſt convert me;

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> that by deferring our Converſion we are not onely in danger, but under a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of never being converted: when the Scripture exhorts us to ſeek God while he may be found, it teaches us there is a Time when he will not be found; what then muſt a man expect whom God hath ſought in vain ſeveral yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and who has been inſenſible to all his Goodneſs?</p>
                     <p>Do we thinck our ſelves too young to be devout, and that we ought to ſtay till we are older, and then be converted? This is as much as to ſay that we have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently offended God, that when we have abus'd his goodneſs more and driven our ingratitude as farr as we can, we wil then begin to ſerve him. Will he accept of our ſervice then? Tis true; God will
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50233:106"/>never refuſe a Sinner that is really converted, but the difficulty lyes in being converted; ſeeing we will not be converted now when God deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res it, can we be ſure of doing it when we shall have all the Reaſon in the world to doubt whether he continues to deſire it.</p>
                     <p>Could the Apoſtles reaſonably expect a ſecond call from Chriſt to leave all and follow him, if they had delay'd till next day to obey the firſt? could they expect to have more courage next day? they who were <hi>invited to the ſupper</hi> in the Goſpel were but twiee invited and excus'd themſelves but once upon very plauſible pretences,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.16.</note> which were yet ſufficient to exclude them for ever from the Feaſt and to ſeal their Reprobation.</p>
                     <p>The Difficulties and obſtacles we meet with now, and which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend are already invincible will aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in number and force every day; we ſay we cannot be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now, we shall be leſs able here after; the ſpiritual helps of reading and meditating on the great Trutbs
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50233:106"/>of the Goſpel, the Counſels of a wiſe Director, the frequentation of the Sacraments have no effect on us now: upon what then do we build our hopes of Converſion? we would not yield at firſt when we were touch'd with thoſe truths, much leſs thall we yield our ſelves when we are grown inſenſible.</p>
                     <p>We accuſtom our ſelves to every thing in time, the beſt advice and the moſt terrible Truths, will make no impreſſion on our affections and leſs on our hearts; like thoſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are continually about dying people we shall by degrees looſe all ſence of what terrify'd us at firſt. By fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſlighting the thoughts of Hell, we shall become little afraid of it; Do we expect to be diſabus'd then? Alas! we are already convinc'd of our danger; for why do we intend to turn to God at laſt, if we be not perſuaded that we are in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtate?</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe a longer experience should make us ſee our Error, and wean us from the falſe pleaſure, &amp; the falſe Liberty of the world, ſo that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50233:107"/>we ceaſe to eſteem them, we thall ſtill retain them out of cuſtom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, obſtinacy, or inclination. Though we glory no longer in being Libertins, in following the maximes of the world &amp; in not being devout we shall inſenſibly continue ſo becauſe we are us'd to it; Unleſs we are abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be deceiv'd, we can not propoſe to our ſelves to overcome ſo many multiplied obſtacles all at once; when with a greater aſſiſtance of grace than we can expect, &amp; with leſs guilt we have not courage to enough to conquer one ſingle Sin.</p>
                     <p>We perſuade our ſelves that at the hour of death, the ſence of approac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing danger will make us turn to God; but how can we rely upon a Converſion to which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited onely by the preſence of Death, and which muſt therefore infallibly be the effect of Fear?</p>
                     <p>And for a clear proof that thoſe Converſions are ſeldom ſincere how many have we ſeen truly converted after a great Sickneſs? beſides it is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50233:107"/>an Article of our Faith that the Son of man will come at an hour when he is leaſt expected, ſo that althô the Death of the greateſt part of mankind be not ſudden yet it is unforeseen; and Jeſus-Chriſt hath declar'd with an Oath that he will be inflexible to all the prayers of thoſe who expect their laſt hour to turn to him, ſo that we muſt either believe the Son of God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, or that he had a deſign to deceive us, or we muſt believe that the ſinner who deferrs his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to a Death-bed will dye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour do's not Say that we shall continue obſtinate to the laſt, that we shall not beg him to forgive us, or that we shall not have Time, but I foretell you (ſaith he) that you shall dye as you have liv'd.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt all wayes hope; true but that is no Chriſtian hope which is contrary to our Faith.</p>
                     <p>The merits of our Redeemer might indeed ſave us, if his word
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50233:108"/>and his Goſpel had not already condemn'd us.</p>
                     <p>Can we imagine that the great work of Eternal Salvation which is the work of our whole Lives, and for which Chriſt himſelfe judg'd no leſs time neceſſary, can be done in a few hours? that it can be done well in thoſe laſt moments? After all this: can we believe that when we have delay'd it from one day to another, we may eaſily do it not withſtanding we put our ſelves under a kind of neceſſity of not doing it at all?</p>
                     <p>Where Eternity is concern'd we ought to hope only on ſolid grounds; The only foundation of hope is the word of God, and yet we hope againſt this expreſs word.</p>
                     <p>How long hath God ſollicited us to be converted? &amp; yet how long do we continue to reſiſt his grace?</p>
                     <p>If we had no other motives than the aſſurance that Grace is offer'd us, that God is ready to receive
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50233:108"/>us, that we may be this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if we will in the condition we shall wish for, when we come to dye the want of which will then drive us to deſpair; do we need any other to make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve?</p>
                     <p>Would a damn'd ſoul delay one moment if he had any time, and the means of Converſion that I have? thoſe wretched Souls were once what I am, have not I reaſon to fear that I shall be one day what they are? they deferr'd their Converſion and are damn'd for it, am not I in danger of being damn'd for the ſame delay?</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſtrange that we can put off our Converſion to the laſt; that is, to do the moſt important and difficult work in the world: we wait for a ſeaſon wherein we shall be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncapable of any thing; wherein a man would be thought mad or at leaſt imprudent that should talk to us of buſineſs. Is a ſick or dying man in a condition to talk of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? And yet it is to this time which we our ſelves acknowledge
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50233:109"/>to very unfit for the moſt trivial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, that we deferr the greateſt buſineſs in the world, the buſineſs of Salvation, &amp; of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>How can we think of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted one day and yet deferr it though but to the next day? The deſign of being converted implies that we believe our Souls in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that we are ſenſible of want of Love to God, that we do not ſerve him faithfully. That we are out of his favour, and that we dare not dye in the ſtate in which we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. He who deferrs his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wilfully lives in a continual danger, by which ſo many perish every Day, he refuſes to love God, &amp; is content to be out of favour with him: he reſolves to live in à State wherein he is afraid to dye, and this after ſerious reflection, and after ſeveral deſigns to change his Life; he reſolves to perſiſt in enmity to God at the very time when God tenders him his Grace and preſſes him to accept his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Can any Chriſtian, can any rational man make this reflection
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50233:109"/>&amp; afterwards deferr his Converſion one moment.</p>
                     <p>Alas my Dear Saviour! I am but too capable of doing this; theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and an hundred more will be to no purpoſe if thou doſt not convert me; Oh! do it for thy mercys ſake; as this is the day whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein I reſolve to be converted, ſo let it be the Day of my perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>

                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that nothing is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as Time every moment is worth an Eternity; that the glory of the Saints, the Eternal joys of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50233:110"/>heaven which Chriſt hath purchas'd for us by his blood are the reward of the good uſe we make of our Time.</p>
                     <p>Time is ſo precious that the ſmalleſt part of it is worth more than all the honours and Riches in the world, &amp; tho we employ but one moment to get all thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Riches, if that be all we gain by it, God who judges righteouſly will look upon that moment as loſt If a damn'd Soul were maſter all the Kingdoms of the Earth he would give them all, and all its Treaſures for one of thoſe precious minutes which he for merly ſpent in folly and which we looſe every Day.</p>
                     <p>Comprehend if you can what Grace and the poſſeſſion of God is; this Grace, this God are the price of our Time, which is given us onely to obtain more grace and by its aſſiſtance to merit the enjoyment of God; and it is certain that by every moment we ſpend for any thing elſe, we looſe more than the whole world can repay.</p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:50233:110"/>
                     <p>The Saints in Heaven by reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated perfect acts of vertue to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can not merit a greater degree of Glory, yet this I can merit every moment if I will, by one true act of Love to God: Reprobates will not be able to ſatisfy the divine juſtice, nor to obtain the pardon of one ſin by all their regrets and tears, nor by an Eternity of dread ful Sufferings, but I may do it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment by one ſigh or one tear; by one act of contrition I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God.</p>
                     <p>Eternal happineſs or miſery will be the conſequence of my uſe or abuſe of Time; I can work out my Salvation onely while Time laſts; how then can men be ſo much at a loſs how to employ their time? how can they amuſe themſelves and be taken up with trifles, only to paſse away the time? You do not know how to ſpend the Time. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve you never offended God? are you not oblig'd to him? have you receiv'd no favours from him? Ought not you to adore and ſerve him? The glorious Saints do not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50233:111"/>think Eternity too long to love, to praiſe, to bleſs, and honour him, and shall we think an hour of a day too long?</p>
                     <p>You dont know what to do; have you no ſins to grieve for? Dont you know that Jeſus-Chriſt is in perſon on the Altar where he expects to be ador'd &amp; is ador'd but by few? and can you want em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for your time? we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at a loſs, how to ſpend our ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me but when we have moſt time to ſerve and love God: For we can ſpend whole days in buſineſs and vain pleaſures, in offending God and deſtroying our Souls, with hout being uneaſy, or thinking the Time long.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider that we can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Salvation only while Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me laſts, and that all the time of our lives is given us only for this End, how careful ought we then to be of improving it? every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is precious; we looſe all if we looſe our time.</p>
                     <p>But do we much value this loſs? Do we think that there is ſuch

                     <p>But alas! a Time wil come when we shall think otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, becauſe we shall have juſter thoughts; a time will come whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein we shall regret thoſe favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble days and hours which we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend now. A time will come when we would give all the world to recall ſome of thoſe precious moments which we now throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and wilfully looſe; when we shall be torn with deſpair to find that they are all loſt, and that time is paſt.</p>
                     <p>Then you will cry out, Oh! that I were now in the condition I was in ſuch a Day of my Life; when I was meditating upon the improvement of Time: Oh! that I had now the ſame health and ſtrength; my God! what would I not do? but wretch that I am, I

                     <p>Time is short, it ends with our Lives; wee have already paſs'd the greateſt part of them, and to what purpoſe? what uſe have I made of this laſt year? how much time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve I loſt in doing what I ought not, or in omitting what I ought to have done? and how little of it have I ſpent in doing my duty? My God! what a terrible account have I to give of my Time &amp; of theſe preſent Reflctions?</p>
                     <p>How can I expect mercy from God if I make no better uſe of what is left? if I deferr my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion any longer? how many are dead who were in better health than I ſome months ago? how many ſeem now in their full vigour who will be in the grave before the year is paſt? and how do I know that I shall not be one of them?</p>
                     <p>Let us then work while we have time, we cannot expect it

                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that you can never repair the loſs of Time, that all you can do will never recall one moment, and if you be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reflection and be ſeriously deſirous of Salvation, this will be ſufficient to convince you of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of redeeming time.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that all the moments of our Lives are counted, let us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them well or ill, we shall not increaſe their number, for it is fix'd and leſſens continually. An hour ago we had ſo much more time to work out our Salvation, an hour hence we shall have ſo much leſs.</p>
                     <p>Tho we live holily after the example of Sainr Paul and do not looſe one moment of what is left; yet it is moſt certain that a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once gone will return no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and that if it be employed ill 'tis loſt. If we employ the reſt of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50233:113"/>our time well we may eſcape the dangers into which our abuſe of the paſt has brought us, but we cannot undo what we have done; we have ſtill loſt ſo many precious hours and with them all the graces which God would have beſtowed on us, &amp; all the good we might have done in them.</p>
                     <p>My God! what a loſs is this? ſo many moments loſt ſince we had firſt the uſe of reaſon, and with them ſo many graces beyond recovery.</p>
                     <p>When we ſpend hours and days in vanity we call it paſſing the Time, a phraſe very unfit for a Chriſtians mouth: we paſs a way, the time, Time it ſelf paſſes away, the Time ſo paſs'd is loſt, and neither it nor the graces we could have merited in it will return any more.</p>
                     <p>The Grace of Predeſtination is in ſome manner annex'd to ſome certain moments, what will beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of us if God has fix'd ours to ſome of thoſe moments that are paſt &amp; loſt! The fear of having loſt it is indeed a ſure and ſenſible mark
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50233:113"/>that I am not yet deprived of it, but what muſt I expect if I let ſlip this opportunity, and do not grow better by this fear?</p>
                     <p>We know time is precious and short, and yet we complain it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſlowly, we are continually wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing for ſome time to come; whence proceeds this uneaſineſs? are we weary of living? no; but we make ill uſe of our Time, and that loſs which we ſee and feel diſturbs our quiet and makes us think the time long: All our pleaſures and diverſions cannot free us from this uneaſineſs, which never quits thoſe who looſe their Time. But they who improve it well for their Salvation are not ſubject to this uneaſineſs, nothing is ſo eaſy ſo full of peace as they. Many Saints have with Saint Paul deſired to be deliver'd from their Exile that they might perfectly enjoy their God and be out of danger of loſing him, but we never find that they were uneaſy in the diſcharge of their duty's in doing the will of God. So true it is that to be entirely ſatisfy'd and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50233:114"/>contented we need onely make a good uſe of time by yielding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Divine Will.</p>
                     <p>But here let us examine what uſe we have made of our Time; its paſs'd, &amp; if it be loſt too, how great is our loſs? how shall we repair it?

                     <p>
                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that altho every man pretends to be willing to be ſaved, yet there are but very few truly willing. The moſt hardned Sinner will ſometimes tell you that he intends to be converted, the moſt unfaithfull Religious believes
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50233:115"/>himſelf deſirous of perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man is ſo mad or ſo much his own Enemy as to be fond of ruine, and we know that without Converſion we are ruin'd for ever.</p>
                     <p>But if we ſtop there and content our ſelves with ſaying we deſire it, without making uſe of the means, we have indeed the thought of Converſion but not the will. If we conſult either our faith or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the torments of Hell will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he us afraid, and the great Truths of our Religion will ſtartle us: but we deceive our ſelves if we take this for Converſion, tis onely a conviction that we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
                     <p>A good natural diſpoſition or Education may inſpire us with an admiration of virtue and an horror of vice, but the underſtanding has a greater thare in theſe Sentiments than the will, and it is much to be feared that ſuch an averſion to Sin is onely an hatred of its dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mall conſequences, and ſuch a love of Piety is no more than an agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50233:116"/>Idea of the happineſs that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, without any efficacious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Let us not deceive our ſelves we we shall not be judg'd according to the good thoughts we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, but according to the good works we have done: Hell is full of ſouls who were as willing to be ſaved as the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are, and can we content our ſelves with no better a will than theirs?</p>
                     <p>We do not deſign to be damn'd; there is not one Soul in Hell that ever deſign'd it: but like a fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſick man who ſays he would fain be well yet will not take any thing to make him ſo, who ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy's himſelfe with thinking on the benefits of health but will make uſe of no means to be cur'd; ſo we deſire to be ſav'd, but we will not make uſe of the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Can any man in his wits imagine that this is the way to Heaven? and what truth would there be in our Religion if it were?</p>
                     <p>Can we fancy that a faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50233:116"/>is ſufficient to ſave us with out uſe of means? all the damn'd Souls have had that deſire? Can we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a thought ſo injurious to the wiſdom of Jeſus-Chriſt, and ſo unworthy of our holy Faith? Chriſt will not have the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourious carefull Chriſtians believe themſelves out of danger and ſure of their reward, tho they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect'd none of the means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho they have liv'd in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe of all virtues: and shall we think we make our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſure while we do nothing for it, while we are ſo plung'd in the Love and purſuit of the world that we hardly remember that we are Chriſtians? If we can once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we may be ſaved without the uſe of means, we muſt believe that Chriſt had a deſign to impoſe upon us, in giving us ſuch Laws; we muſt look on all the Saints as men who had loſt their Reaſon, for why should they think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſav'd without living up to the ſtrictneſs of the Goſpell, if none be damn'd but thoſe who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50233:117"/>and in cold blood reſolve to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>One would think it impoſſible for any Chriſtian to entertain ſo palpable an error, for who can expect to attain an end without uſing the means? yet how many are there who ſay the would be ſaved, that will not uſe the means? How many Religious think their whole work done when they have left the world?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> that men are ſeldom ſo unreaſonable as to expect to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd without making uſe of means; but they pick and chooſe, they will make uſe of ſome but not of all; they will uſe thoſe means that pleaſe them beſt, not thoſe that are moſt proper for attaining their End.</p>
                     <p>Like the ſick man of whom S. Ignatius ſpeaks, who chooſes his Phyſick, not by the Doctors advice but his own Palat; refuſes thoſe preſcriptions which are proper for his diſtemper, and takes onely ſuch as pleaſe his taſt, can we think that ſuch a man is efficaciouſly deſirous to be cur'd?</p>
                     <p>Is that deſire of Salvation with which we pleaſe our ſelves, more ſincere? We rarely meet with men who reſolve to obſerve neitver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50233:118"/>nor counſels: we would be ſaved, and we are willing to uſe ſome means, provided we may chooſe them: Among ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as Chriſt has given us, 'tis impoſſible that we should have an averſion for all, we chooſe only thoſe that pleaſe us, tho the reſt be never ſo neceſſary. Enormous ſins fright us, but the reſervedneſs ſo neceſſary to preſerve our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence do's not agree with us; we are ready to give our ſelves to God, if we may have leave to retain our favourite paſſion.</p>
                     <p>If we find no difficulty in faſting we are eaſily convinc'd that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain Heaven without it: but becauſe we find it leſs eaſy to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our paſſions, to pardon injurys, &amp; to obſerve a ſerious recollection; we think it ſufficient to faſt, and that we may diſpenſe with the reſt, without danger.</p>
                     <p>Hence proceeds that monſtrous mixture of virtues and vices in the-ſame perſons who make profeſſion of Holineſs, to the prejudice of true and real virtue: hence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50233:119"/>that we ſee ſo little amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we truſt to thoſe virtues which we think we have, and take no notice of the greateſt part of our faults.</p>
                     <p>We do indeed make uſe of ſome means but not of all, and thoſe we chooſe are generally the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to attain our End we do not examine whether they be the beſt, but whether they be the eaſieſt, the moſt ſuitable to our inclinations, and which pleaſe us moſt. We are ready to quit this occaſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, but we will not break off an accquaintance or renounce an employment tho it be a continual Source of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Some are willing to give alms, but they are unwilling to enquire if they have nothing that belongs to another, for fear of being oblig'd to reſtitution; ſome are willing to make reſtitution but they will not think of pardoning an injury; others are inclin'd to forgive, but they will not Sacrifice a criminal or dangerous friendship to the care of their Salvation: A Religious
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50233:119"/>man is reſolv'd never to return into the world, but the takes little pains to perfect himſelf in his Station; he trembles at the thought of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Vows, but he ſlights the obſervation of his Rule, tho the keeping of his vows generally depends on the ſtrict obſervation of it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men have indeed ſome Reaſon to think that they are unwilling to be damn'd; but it is certain that they do not really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaved; 'tis evident that they deſire it onely by halves, their deſire is not ſincere by ſeeming to do ſome thing for Salvation they think themſelves ſecure, while by not doing all that is requir'd of them they render their peril much greater.</p>
                     <p>Can that man be in earneſt who ſays he deſires to be ſav'd, and yet refuſes to make uſe of all the means? when a ſick man refuſes to take all neceſſary remedy's, have not we reaſon to tell him, ſurely you have a mind to dye? this is juſt the caſe of moſt men who ſay
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50233:120"/>they would be ſaved, yet will not uſe all neceſſary means; may we not very well make them the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſurely you have a mind to be damn'd?</p>
                     <p>Where is our ſincerity? Where is our Truth? can we impoſe upon our ſelves ſo farr as to think that we ſincerely deſire to ſave our ſouls at the ſame time that we neglect them ſo ſtrangely? While we are ſo earneſt and diligent when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſucceed in any worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                     <p>What a difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween a man following his buſineſs or his ſtudy, and the ſame man working out his Salvation? Were we as earneſt for heaven as we are for honours and Riches, we should ſoon be great Saints; for we cannot be rich if we will, but we may be be Saints if we will.</p>
                     <p>We are not contented to make uſe of all neceſſary means to obtain our temporal ends, we employ even thoſe that are not neceſſary, and we juſtify all this care and pains by ſaying that we would not have
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50233:120"/>any neglect to reproach our ſelves; do we obſerve this maxim in the buſineſs of our ſoul? shall we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve nothing to reproach our ſelves on a Death bed?</p>
                     <p>If we do not deſign to be ſaved why do we make uſe of any means? if we de deſign it, why do we not make uſe of all? is it not becauſe ſome are more difficult than others? but to what purpoſe do we practiſe onely thoſe that are eaſy, ſince they are all neceſſary? Are we ignorant that he who do's not do all he ought to be ſaved, is no more advanc'd than of he had done nothing?</p>
                     <p>Do we think ſome few and doubt ful means ſufficient in a buſineſs of conſequence? And would we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture its ſucceſs upon ſuch means as common experience has found very improper for a buſineſs of that nature? certainly the buſineſs of Salvation is a buſineſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus-Chriſt hath declar'ed that he will have all or nothing, that he will accept no divided heart,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50233:121"/>there is no medium, they who are not abſolutely for him, are againſt him. Yet notwithſtanding we all know this, lukewarmneſs &amp; tepidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this divided heart is the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of moſt Chriſtians at this day.</p>
                     <p>Thus we live; but did any of the Saints ſanctify himſelfe by ſuch a Life? Do not we our ſelves doubt of the Salvation of thoſe who dye in ſuch a State? What shall we think of our condition if we don't take other meaſures after all theſe Reflections? can we reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expect to be ſaved?</p>
                     <p>And that which makes our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yet more viſible, is that our Lives are a manifeſt contradiction to our Faith; and yet we do not mind it: we are convinc'd that it is neceſſary to Salvation to believe the miſtery of the Trinity, and of the Euchariſt, notwithſlanding all the difficulties that ſence &amp; reaſon ſuggeſt, becauſe God hath reveal'd them: but hath not the ſame God declared that he who will be ſaved muſt abhorr the maxims of the

                     <p>But our Religion is too ſincere not to condemn this contradiction between our Faith and manners; it teaches us that God requires all or nothing, &amp; ſurely he deſerves very little if he do's not deſerve all: it would be better for us to give him none, than not to give him all: ſuch a diviſion is exceeding injurious to him; for infine, we carry our ſelves thus only to thoſe whom we neither reſpect nor fear; God abhorrs this conduct, he hates te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity more than coldneſs, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore cannot endure to be ſerv'd by halves.</p>
                     <p>Abſolute perfection is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50233:122"/>but our Saviour commands every one efficaciouſly to ſeek per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in his ſtation; do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that the number of theſe men of good will is ſo very ſmall that if this be true there will be but few ſaved; who can doubt of it after what Chriſt hath told us of the ſmall number of the Elect? Do we ſee many who <hi>love God with all their hearts?</hi> how can we pretend that we are ſinceeely deſirous of Salvation while we do not obſewe this firſt and great Commandment? while we make uſe onely of ſome meanes and neglect the reſt &amp; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le we ſatisfy, our ſelves with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me pretended good works of our own chooſing, and indulge our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in our belov'd paſſion which is a continual Source of Sin.</p>
                     <p>I ſee now my God that I have not been truly willing; that I have hitherto deceiv'd my ſelfe with a falſe deſire, which hath kept me in ignorance of the greatneſs of my danger; but I am now reſolv'd ſincerly to be ſaved at anyrate; And I have ſome grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

                     <p>The State of a Soul in mortal ſin is very dangerous, but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour judges a lukewarm ſtate to be yet worſe, for he tells the Angel or Bishop of the Church of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea, I would 'thou wert either cold or hot for becauſe thou art lukewarm and neither col nor hot,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50233:124"/>I will caſt thee out of my mouth as tainted &amp; offenſive.</p>
                     <p>Do's Jeſus-Chriſt who bears with the greateſt Sinners, who is alwayes ready to pardon them, who did not abhorr even Judas himſelfe; do's he abhorr a lukewarm Soul? hath he who is ſo tender towards Sinners, no tenderneſs, no love, for a Soul that is neither cold nor hot? What hopes then can ſuch a Soul have of being ſaved?</p>
                     <p>We ought not to deſpair of the Salvation of the moſt notorious Sinner; though his diſorders and crimes have renderd his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion difficult we ought ſtill to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, for he knows his Sins &amp; is therefore more capable of being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſenſible of them and of hating them. Tell the greareſt Sinner of the ſevere judgments of God, of Death, and of the rigourf and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Eternal Torments; the foree of theſe terrible verity's may alarm and convert him: but all this makes no impreſſion on a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Soul, his condition is without remedy; becauſe it abſtains from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50233:125"/>crying and ſcandalous Sins which ſtartle a Soul that hath any fear left, 'it do's not mind Spiritual and interior faults, it mingles them with ſome actions of Piety, ſo that they eaſily paſs unregarded by a Conſcience that is not exceeding tender, and thus not knowing the greatneſs of its danger it do's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>Nothing do's a Soul Good in this condition; Prayers, exhortations, reading, maſſes, meditations, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, are all fructleſs: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that the little benefit it hath hithertho receiv'd by them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves it a disguſt, and takes away its deſire to make uſe of them; or that being accuſtom'd to them they have leſs effect; that having heard theſe terrible truths diſcours'd of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, and having as often diſcours'd of them its ſelfe to no purpoſe, they make no impreſſion on it.</p>
                     <p>It receives but few graces becauſe of its unfaithfulneſs in thoſe which it do's receive; its faults are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes great becauſe they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50233:125"/>with an higher contempt, a greater malice &amp; a blacker ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than the faults of others: this odious mixture of good and bad which compoſes the caracter of a lukewdarm Soul diſcovers clearly how injurious ſuch a conduct is to God: the ſeeming good works that it do's are a convincing proof that it hath not forgotten God, but its careleſs and imperfect way of doing them shews how little it ſtands in awe of that God whom it ſerves with ſo much indifference and diſguſt: And indeed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt is mutual, it has an averſion to Chriſt and Chriſt hath an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it; no wonder that ſuch men immediately after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions are ready to return again to and renew their Sins as if they had not receiv'd; the Opinion of their pretended good works tenders them proof againſt all wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; they can hear it with all the coldneſs in the world, and 'tis this that makes ſo many good thoughts and holy inſpirattons uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

                     <p>Hence proceeds the ſtrange blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefs of a lukewarm Souls, and that horrible inſenſibility which is the heavieſt of judgments, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree of miſery: And there fore S.

                     <p>What hope is left for ſuch a Soul? there is no remedy for it; it will not be cur'd, becauſe it is not ſenſible of its illneſs: It is a ſick Creature whoſe condition is the more deſperate becauſe it laughs at thoſe who think its ſick; ſo that there is need of a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to convert a lukewarm Soul, than to make the blind to ſee or to raiſe the dead to Life.</p>
                     <p>None but thou my God canſt do it, thou art able to cure the moſt inveterate diſeaſes; but thou hateſt Lukewarmneſs, and this makes me fear; I cannot pray with that confidence as I would for the moſt ſcandalous ſinner; I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have been hirher to in

                     <p>An heinous Sinner eaſily knows his danger; there are eertain favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable moments where in by the help of grace he diſcovers ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in his Soul that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently laments his miſery, which knowledge and confeſſion render his converſion much leſs difficult.</p>
                     <p>But a lukewarm ſoul do's not believe that ke is lukewarm; he

                     <p>Its unfaithfulneſs being gradual it is leſs ſenſible of them, then its faults grow habitual, and at laſt it takes pleaſures in them: nothing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it when it is in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it ſuſpectes nothing: it is not ſenſible of any new fault; it grows lukewarm without omitting one of its devotions; 'tis the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of theſe very devotions that give birth to its tepidity, and help it to deceive its ſelfe by covering its reall faults with a falſe appearance of vertue.</p>
                     <p>God himſelfe who ſo loudly a larms the Sinner is now ſilent and will not awake him; but leaves him to dye in this mortal Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: I will begin ſays he to caſt thee out, he do's not do it all at

                     <p>And what hope can he have to be cur'd? how is it poſſible for him to recover out of this diſmall ſtate? The advice of his true Friends, the pious counſelli of his wiſe director, and of his zealous Superior, and the beſt examples, are all ill received: by his inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and hardneſs of heart he ſeems to be enchanted, all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bear the viſible marks of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reprobation, and that God hath left him.</p>
                     <p>Saint Bonaventure obſerves that it is no extraordinary thing to ſee notorious ſinners quit their ſins and become truly penitent, but that it is very extraordinary to ſee a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewarm Soul recover. And to this we may apply the words of <hi>S. Paul</hi> in that terrible paſſage at which all thoſé who grow cold after having been fervent in the ſervice of God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50233:128"/>should tremble; <hi>it is impoſſible</hi> (that is extremely difficult) <hi>for them who were once enlightned and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> preferably to many others, and of the ſwetneeſs of a Spititual Life, and of ſaving Truths, <hi>if they fall away,</hi> if they grow weary of ſerving God and return to theyr Sins, <hi>it is impoſſible to renew them again unto Repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But my God what is all this to a lukewarm Soul unleſs by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of mercy thou art pleas'd to open his eyes and to make him ſee his dangers? he do's not ſuſpect himſelfe of being fallen away, nor will he ſuſpect it till thou diſcover it to him by an inward light; and what will it avail him to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of it, unleſſe thou giveſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſupply of grace to recover him from that wreched State?</p>
                     <p>Let us now examine if we have no reaſon to fear? The Lukewarm are exceeding curious, they will try all Sorts of devotions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may poſſibly read this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50233:128"/>but let them not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this day of retreat may be profitable if we examine impartially and diligently whether this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tepidity do's not influence all our actions, whether the Sacraments are uſefull to us, and whether we grow daily leſs imperfect by the Exerciſes of Virtue.</p>

                     <p>Imagine that you ſee in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth a vaſt and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lake of fire and flames, the

                     <p>How glad would theſe wretches be to ſuffer only from our fire, notwithſtanding the horrour of being thrown into a burning gulph, but alas! there is no comparaiſon between it and the fire of Hell: my God! what tourments! Ours is lightſome, theirs dark; Ours is an effect of the goodneſs and bounty of God, theirs is the product of his incens'd Omnipotence, and of the infinite hatred he bears to Sin: tis a fire which the Almighly do's all he can to render furious &amp;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50233:130"/>raging; and alas! it is not their onely torment, this fire makes them feel at the ſame time all ſorts of pains.</p>
                     <p>Repreſent ro your ſelfe a man tormented with the gout or a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent colique; what pains do's he feel? how do's he cry out? how willingly would he dye to put an end' to his torture? and yet he ſuffers onely in one part of his body, he hath the Liberty of complaining &amp; the ſatisfaction of ſeeing himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe pityed; what would it be if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member ſuffer'd the ſame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? if inſtead of helping him the ſtanders by abus'd him without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to complain?</p>
                     <p>In hell, the damn'd do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the pains to which we are ſubject in this Life, they ſuffer all theſe and infinitely more, their torments are univerſal, violent, complicated, and all exceſſive, in one inſtant they feel them all, and in the midſt of all they cannot receive or ſo much as hope for any eaſe, what would one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be againſt a whole Sea of flames?

                     <p>Yet all theſe dreadful torments are nothing to their deſpair when they look back on the time that is loſt, and the ill uſe they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of it. The thoughts of the damn'd will be employ'd to all Eternity in calling to mind the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of thoſe objects which made them forget God.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50233:131"/>whoſe vain opinion, cenſures, and power I ſtood ſo much in awe? Yet theſe I preferr'd to the favour &amp; love of God and for theſe I have loſt my Soul.</p>
                     <p>The opportunitys of Salvation which he hath abus'd and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that he hath loſt, will take up the thoughts of a damn'd ſoul to all Eternity: How eaſyly might I have confeſs'd ſuch a Sin? God offer'd me his Love, he gave me warning, he preſs'd and ſollicited me ſo long, &amp; gave me ſo many years of health ſince my fall; I paſs'd for a wiſe man in the world: Oh! how came I to deferr my converſion to the hour of Death? How often have I trembled at the thought of my danger, at the apprehenſion of damnation? And yet am damn'd at laſt: I needed onely have done thoſe good worke which ſuch a friend, ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſuch a Relation, have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; I began well, it would have coſt me little to perſevere, and if it had coſt me never ſo much, could

                     <p>Add to theſe inconcevable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to theſe cruel regrets, the the irreconciliable loſs of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Good; the ſence of a God it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to Eternity, of a God loſt without recovery, loſt for ever, this is the height and perfection of their miſery; they never ceaſe to be the Victims of the Divine wrath and vengeance; we muſt know what God is before we can be able to conceive what it is to looſe him without hope: tho we are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little affected with it now, they who have loſt him have other thoughts. How inſupportable will be the remembrance that I had a Redeemer, but I ſlighted the price by which I was redeemed? that my Saviour lov'd me to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and that it is impoſſible for me to love him, that I am hated by him, and that he will never have any compaſſion on my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                     <p>O! my Dear Saviour! who haſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50233:132"/>ſuffer'd ſo much ſo recall me, who haſt bought me with ſo great a price that I might not be loſt; thou will take pleaſure to ſee me plung'd into this fiery gulph: thou will heap everlaſting miſery on me without mercy, thou wilt be no longer my Father, nor my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: no wonder if Hell be a place of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, of deſpair and woe, ſince the Almighty who made the world by one act of his will, do's all he can, ſeems to exert all his power &amp; force to make a wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>There is an Hell, and yet there are Sinners; Chriſtians believe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is an Hell, and yet this hell is full of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>There is an Hell; and at this very moment an infinite number of miſerable Souls are tormented in it: 'tis certain that many of thoſe with whom we converſe, that many of thoſe who read this, and who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the torments of Hell, will one day be caſt into thoſe everlaſting flames.</p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:50233:133"/>
                     <p>And am not I like to be one of them? Divine Saviour! thou haſt not bought me to deſtroy me: but haſt not thou alſo shed thy blood for thoſe that are loſt? This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes me fear and tremble; but what good will this fear do me if I looſe my Soul? Oh! my good Maſter! I wil be ſav'd what ever it coſt me; I humbly beſeech thee by thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood ſuffer me not to be damn'd; what will it advance thy glory to shut me up for ever in that abyſs of fire and flames?

Life tho conſider'd never ſo near appears but a moment; the time paſt of it, ſeems but an inſtant to us who live, and when we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to dye tho we have liv'd long we can hardly perſuade our ſelves that there hath been any interval between the day of our births, and the prefent Day: all that is paſt ſeems a Dream; what then will it be after Death? when ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of years are over, when our deſcendants for many generations
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50233:134"/>are all forgotten; when time has ruin'd our houſes, deſtroy'd the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, and overturn'd the Kingdoms wherein we liv'd: when the end of Ages shall have bury'd the whole Univerſe in its own ashes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite millions of Ages after?</p>
                     <p>This is dreadful, but all this is not Eternity; when a damn'd ſoul shall have ſuffered all theis while, and an hunded thouſand times as much, 'tis nothing to Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Were one of the damn'd oblidg'd to fill the hollow of a mans hand with his tears, and to drop but one ſingle tear at the end of each thouſand years, what a terrible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would this be? Cain the firſt of the damn'd, would have shed but ſix or ſeven, Judas but one; but if he were oblidg'd at the ſame rate to make a brook or a river of his tears, to fill the Sea or the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent between heaven and Earth, what a prodigious length of time would this require? Our imagination is loſt and confounded in ſo vaſt a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but all this great and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceva bleextent of time is nothing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50233:134"/>to Eternity: A time will come when every one of thoſe wretched Souls will be able toſay, one tear for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thouſand years that I have been in Hell would have drown'd the Univerſe and fill'd up the immenſe ſpace between Heaven and Earth, and yet I have an Eternity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable torments ſtill to ſuffer; all I have ſuffered is nothing to this Eternity; after millions of Ages as many times multiplyed, after an extenſive duration in which our thoughts are loſt, the fire of Hell will be as violent and fierce, the damn'd will be as capable of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as ſenſible of their pains, and God as incens'd &amp; as far from being appeas'd as the firſt moment.</p>
                     <p>Oh! dreadfull, Oh! incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Eternity! were we only to burn for every wicked thought as many millions of Ages as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve liv'd days, hours, or minutes, our pains would have an end at laſt; but to know certainly that our tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will never end; alwayes to ſuffer, &amp; be aſſured that we shall alwayes ſuffer, to be allwayes thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50233:135"/>on the happineſs we have loſt, on the torments we have brought upon our ſelves, on the means of avoiding them which we have had; to have continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the vanity of every thing we have preferr'd to God, and the little while that our pleaſures have laſted, the unutterable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we might have taſted in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the vaſt difference between the pains we fear'd in the practiſe of virtue, and thoſe which we are now forc'd to ſuffer in the flames of Hell to have the thoughts of this Eternity allwayes preſent, and to burn, rage, and deſpair for ever: my God! what miſery!</p>
                     <p>If theſe reflections do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us, if the proſpect of thoſe Torments, of this Eternity do's not touch us, if the fear of this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting regret do's not wean us from Sin, and from our vain amuſements, are we rational creatures? are we Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>Theſe terrible veritys have made ſo many Martyrs, have peopled the deſerts and daily fill the Convents;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50233:135"/>what do we think of theſe men? did they do wiſely? did they do well to neglect nothing, to do all they were able to avoid Hell?</p>
                     <p>Who would not give all he is worth to be freed from a dungeon? who thinks any pains too great to prolong his Life? But Oh! what do we do, nay what do we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do to avoid Hell?</p>
                     <p>The divine Juſtice is terrible; God punishes theſe that offend him with Eternal torments in Hell; yet we offend him in the ſight of this Hell; certainly an Eternity of miſery is not too ſevere a punishment for ſuch malice; if there were no hell already God should make one on purpoſe for ſuch offenders.</p>
                     <p>The thoughts of Hell make us tremble; we are unwilling to think of it leaſt it thould affright us; and yet we are not afraid to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into it: we are afraid to think of the Eternal duration of thoſe bitter torments, and yet we will not make one ſtep out of the road that leads to them.</p>
                     <p>There is an Hell and yet we
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50233:136"/>delight in pleaſures, and Sinh ath ſtill charms for us; we think the practiſe of virtue difficult, and there are ſtill careleſs and imperfect Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and debauch'd Chriſtians: this ſeems as incomprehenſible as Eternity it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>You object that perfection is not neceſſary to avoid hell; true it is not neceſſary, but can you keep to farr from a Lake of Fire into which ſo many fail? Can you take too much care and too many precautions to preſerve your ſelfe from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire, rage, &amp; deſpair?</p>
                     <p>How cruel muſt the thoughts of a damn'd ſoul be, who knows that he might have been eternally as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as he is eternally miſerable, if he had pleas'd; that he might have been a Saint with eaſe, and is not becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he was not pleas'd to be ſo: that his Brethren are in heaven, but he is in Hell: he laugh'd at thoſe who being afraid of the condition in which he is now, liv'd otherwiſe than he did; and now, what would he not do to be what they are? I call'd an holy exactneſs, melancoly;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50233:136"/>a Chriſtian modeſty &amp; reſervedneſs I call'd ſtupidity, &amp; ſcrupulouſneſs; Oh! that I had been ſo ſtupid, ſo ſcrupulous and melancoly; that exactneſs, that reſerve has made many Saints who are now in heaven abſorpt in Joys; but what is beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me now that I am in flames, of all my mirth and good humour which I affected to shew by rallying eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing? If I had imitated ſuch and ſuch of my acquaintance, if I had made good uſe of the divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſuch a day; if I had been faithful to ſuch a grace, if I had shun'd ſuch an occaſion of Sin, if I had practis'd ſuch a virtue, if I had mortifyed my ſelfe, if I had been truly willing, I should be now in heaven inſtead of which I am damn'd to Eternity, I am loſt, and loſt for ever. Oh terrible regret! And that which aggravates my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is the remembrance how often I have thought on the pains I now endure, on that eternal regret I should one day feel if I were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Yet after all this, men damn
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50233:137"/>themſelves; Great God! thy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is juſt: they deſerve it all.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that we can avoid thinking on Hell? is it poſſible that we can think on it and not be converted? Is it poſſible that we are converted, and do not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to think on it? we muſt have it all wayes before our eyes after our converſion to prevent our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; the greateſt Saints, thoſe pure fouls whoſe hearts were all inflam'd with the Love of God thought it abſolutely neceſſary for them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on Hell, and the apprehenſions of it made them tremble; and can any who pretend to virtue, can any Religious man imagine that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to think on Hell? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch men dare not think on it; they are conſcious to themſelves that they do not take pains enough to give them ground to hope that they shall not be condemn'd; but have they leſs cauſe to fear becauſe they have a greater account to give? And how can they hope to be leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punish'd becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater obligations?</p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:50233:137"/>
                     <p>Chriſt had good reaſon to tell us that Hell is the onely evil we ought to fear; for what is a man the worſe for being hated and perſecuted; for being reduced to a mean and obſcure Life, and for being mortify'd, if he eſcape being damn'd?</p>
                     <p>My God! if thou art reſolved to punish me for my Sins, chaſtiſe me in this Life, but do not damn me.

                     <p>My God! haſt thou given me ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to think on the pains of Hell, onely to augment my deſpair one day, for being damn'd after having thought on theſe pains?

                     <p>
                        <hi>COnſider</hi> that mortification and pennance is the onely way to heaven; Jeſus-Chriſt shew'd us no other way; and the Saints who from their infancy were confirmed in grace, knew no other. Tis an error to imagine that pennance is neceſſary onely for great Sinners, and no leſs an error to think that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50233:138"/>mortification is the virtue onely of the perfect; if we be Sinners we muſt do pennance to endeavour to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to obtain mercy and pardon; if we are ſo happy as not to have loſt our innocence, pennance is neceſſary for us to preſerve that precious treaſure: we have ſin'd, we may ſin again, two powerful motives to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>Since we all confeſs that men ſin more frequently in the world, and that they are more expos'd to the danger of offending God than in a cloyſter, can we reaſonably believe that pennance belongs onely to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery's, and that none but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious are oblig'd to mortification? Do we conſider that many of thoſe Religious whom we think indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably oblig'd to do pennance, never loſt their innocence; &amp; shall we who own our ſelves guilty of many Sins, and who are in danger of committing more every moment, shall we think to perſuade our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves that mortification and pennance do not belong to us?</p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:50233:139"/>
                     <p>It we had nothing but our own paſſions to overcome could we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope to conquer them without the exercice of pennance? and who can reaſonably hope to be ſaved without ſubduing his paſſions?</p>
                     <p>It is an article of Faith that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne enter into heaven but thoſe who do violence to themſelves; and yet we pretend to enter there without mortification. The Life of man upon the earth is a perpetual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, for <hi>S. Paul</hi> telles us that the <hi>deſires of the flesh arc contrary to the deſires of the Spirit, and the deſires of the ſpirit are contrary to thoſe of the flesh;</hi> how then can we hope to be victorious without the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of Pennance?</p>
                     <p>We pleaſe our ſenſual appetites in every thing, we are careful of our body's even to exceſs, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low blindly our natural inclinations, and in this condition we live without fear in the midſt of the world where we are expos'd to the greateſt dangers. Certainly either we are of a different nature from the reſt of mankind, or the Devil
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50233:139"/>ſtands in awe of us and reſpects us, or we are confirm'd in Grace, or elſe we are in danger (which is much more probable) to dye in our Sins: Do's heaven coſt the moſt fervent and generous ſouls ſo much, and can we expect that the lazy and imperfect should gain it with leſs pains?</p>
                     <p>Saint Paul chaſtis'd his body, he joyn'd a continual pennance to the cruell perſecutions he ſuffered, for fear of being perverted himſelfe while he converted others: And shall men who dare not pretend to be any thing near as perfect as S. Paul, imagine that they have no need to practiſe mortification?</p>
                     <p>Were the Saints more frail than we? Did they expect another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe? Did they follow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guide? or ſerve another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Their lives were a continual mortification, are ours like them? And can we call our ſelves the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt while we neglect to do pennance? Our Saviour ſays, if any man will come after me let
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50233:140"/>him deny himſelfe and bear his Croſs daily.</p>
                     <p>True mortification is inſeparable from true piety, not only becauſe no virtue can ſubſiſt long without a conſtant and generous mortification, but alſo becauſe no virtue is real that is not attended with it.</p>
                     <p>We have great reaſon to diſtruſt our exerciſes of piety, our good works; every thing is to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thoſe whoſe paſſions are ſtrong, &amp; who are unmortify'd.</p>
                     <p>It do's not ſeem that we are afraid of the difficulty, we dislike the motive, for what do we not ſuffer in the ſervice of the world? Alas! if God requir'd of his ſervants, all that the world exacts of thoſe who ſerve it, I am afraid he would have but few ſervants.</p>
                     <p>How to we conſtrain our ſelves every day to pleaſe thoſe whom our Intereſt requires us to manage? what mortification ſo ſevere and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual as a Courtiers, a Merchants intent upon his trade, a Soldiers, or a ſcholars? Yet they are not dis
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50233:140"/>courag'd, they ſeem ſatisfy'd amydſt all their ſufferings; but when God calls upon us to conſtrain our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves a little, every thing is uneaſy, we find his yoak heavy, virtue frights us, we are disguſted, and the ſole thought of mortification makes us looſe courage.</p>
                     <p>But oh! we shall have other thoughts on a death bed; when the image of Jeſus-Chriſt crucifyed is preſented to us, will not the ſight of it have a quite contrary effect? it will upbraid our delicacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our regret for having lead ſo lazy, ſo ſenſual a Life, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected pennance and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</p>
                     <p>They preſent a Crucifix to the dying, but my God! do all the dying find much comfort in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating a crucifix at their Death? is it poſſible, my dear Jeſus that the mortification which thou haſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſo eaſy, should ſeem hard and inſupportable only when we are to practiſe it in conformity to thy example, and for Love of thee?</p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:50233:141"/>
                     <p>Oh! my God! what should I do, if thou hadſt requir'd of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if I were bound to do and ſuffer as much for ſalvation, as I do and ſuffer to ruine my ſelfe, thou requireſt leſs than the world do's, leſs than I do and ſuffer in its ſervice, and shall I refuſe to do and ſuffer what is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſalvation, what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by my offenſes, and what all the bleſſed Spirits in heaven have done and ſuffer'd that they might imitate thee?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſider</hi> that by the fruits of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is meant not only macerating our body's, but chiefly the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our paſſious, and the Reformation of our Lives; theſe are indeed the fruits which God expects from our Contrition and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50233:141"/>pennance: by theſe marks we may know whether we have made good uſe of the Sacraments, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be truly ſorry for our Sins, and faithful to the Grace of God.</p>
                     <p>The Exerciſes of Devotion, the frequentation of the Sacrements, and the practiſe of good works are powerful means of perfection; but while we retain our former paſſions with theſe powerful means, while we are as proud, as impatient, as peevish, as envious, as difficult to be pleas'd, as cholerik, as unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd, as ful of ſelfe Love as befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, can we reaſonably rely on theſe pretended exerciſes of Piety?</p>
                     <p>Mortification of the body is an exerciſe of Pennance, but that pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt have its fruit, which conſiſts in ſuppreſſing our paſſions, in regulating our inclinations, and in repairing the diſorders of ſelf-Love.</p>
                     <p>To what purpoſe do we confeſs ſo often, if in a whole years ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we have not perhaps reformed any one of the faults that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs?
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50233:142"/>its is not enough for us to deteſt our Sins, we muſt reſolve to commit them no more, and how can that reſolution be ſincere if we do not likewiſe reſolve to avoid the leaſt occaſion of Sin? The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this reſolution is properly the fruit of pennance. In good earneſt if we know the efficacy of this Sacrament of pennance only by the fruits we find of it in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, should we have an high Idea of it? It is much to he feared that our uſing our ſelves by an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable careleſneſs, and eſpecially by want of contrition to reap no profit by the Sacrament, will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our diſeaſe incurable.</p>
                     <p>A Religious Life is a continual pennance, but is there no danger of its being unfruitful? What a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing would it be for a Religious to have done penance ſo long without any fruit? And what fruit can an unmortify'd Religious who is of a worldly ſpirit, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewarm and careleſs receive from all his pennance? He is very much in the wrong who bears the Croſs,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50233:142"/>and will not taſt the fruits of it? he would not ſuffer more, nay he would ſuffer much leſs, for thoſe fruits are ful of true ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that every body has very much to ſuffer in this life; we shall meet with Croſſes every where, they who live moſt at their eaſe are not exempted: let us at leaſt bear them patiently, let us unite our ſufferings with the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt, this will not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, but it will make us reap fruit by them.</p>
                     <p>Another fruit of pennance is a conſtant practiſe of mortification: My God! what fruit may we not gather from this practiſe? Every thing in the world may give us an opportunity to curb our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there is no place, no time improper for it without deviating from the rules of good ſence. Let him who loves Jeſus-Chriſt truly make a good uſe of theſe little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; have we a great deſire to ſee any object, or to ſpeak in ſome particular occaſion? we may reap great benefit by caſting down our
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50233:143"/>Eyes and holding our thoughts. If we have an opportunity to gain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe by ſaying ſomething very ſeaſonably, or by ſome witty piece of rallery, we have alſo an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making a great Sacrifice. There is ſcarce an hour where in ſome ſubject of mortification do's not preſent it ſelfe are we ſitting or ſtanding, we may chooſe an unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſeat, or a painful poſture without ſeeming to affect it. In fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the inconveniences of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, of the ſeaſon, the diſagreableneſs of the company, born ſo that we ſeem not to mind them, are indeed little occaſions of mortification, but the mortification its ſelfe is not little, in theſe ſmall occaſions. It is very meritorious, and I may ſay that the greateſt graces and the moſt ſublime holineſs commonly depend upon a generous conſtant mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe ſmall matters. A pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual performance of the duty's of our community, an exact obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Rule, a conformity to the common way of living in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, without any regard to our

                     <p>Theſe are the true fruits of pennan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, what hinders our bearing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them?

All other fins may be ſtrangers to us, but the dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring paſſion is our proper caracter, the fruit of a true converſion is to retrench our reigning vice, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an holy deteſtation of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious paſſion, to fight againſt it without ceaſing. The Victory over
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50233:144"/>this Sin alone will deliver us from the ſtrongeſt temptations: but we willingly attack our other ſins and commonly ſpare this: and this is the true cauſe of our receiving ſo little benefit by our penance.</p>
                     <p>My God! what do we ſtay for to become fruitful? thou haſt culti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vated us with ſo much care, we are planted in a ground watered with thy tears and precious blood; how long shall we be unfruitful? what do we get by bringing forth only thorns? we feel their points, but we receive no benefit by our pain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we fly from the Croſs. I am reſolv'd my Dear Saviour to neglect nothing that I may not live ſuch a barren Life: I can do nothing without thy Grace, I can do all things with it, ſince thou giveſt me this Time for penance, ſuffer me not to abuſe it any more; My God I am reſolv'd to begin this moment to bring forth fruits worthy of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

Is it true that I am ſent into the world onely to ſecure it? is it true that I am undone if I do not ſecure it, tho I should gain the whole world? is it true and do I indeed believe that the buſineſs of my Salvation is the greateſt buſineſs I can have?

                     <hi>Our</hi> indifference for Salvation is ſo great, that we muſt own that of all our affaires we neglect this moſt and lay it leaſt to heart. Whence proceeds this unaccountable indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for Eternal happineſs? God gave us our lives only to think on it, he judg'd them all little enough to ſucceed in it; Death for ought we know is very near us; what part of our Life have we ſpent in this important buſineſs? How few years, how few days, nay how few hours have we devoted to it? Have we the confidence to reckon thoſe we ſpend in the Church with ſo much diſtraction and voluntary
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50233:146"/>irreverence? Alas! have we made any great progreſs in thoſe hours? Can we have the face to mention the little time we have given to haſty prayers without devotion, to Confeſſions without ſorrow and without Reformation, to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions without fruit, or to a few pretended good works which we have loſt by doing them upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or which were corrupted by bad motives?</p>
                  <p>We are ſo taken up with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous cares and worldly buſineſs that we can ſpare but a little Time to think of our Salvation, and we grudge the little time we ſpend in thinking of it. What reaſon can we give for ſuch an unreaſonable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? unleſs we will own that it proceeds from want of Faith. If we believ'd that the enjoyment of God, that an Eternity of infinite happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or miſery (which includes &amp; ſurpaſſes all other miſerys) depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on our diligence; if we did really believe what we repeat ſo of ten, that we can not ſerve God and the world at once, that time is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50233:147"/>short, and that Death approaches, that each moment for ought we know may be our laſt; if we did indeed believe that Salvation is our own work and that we onely can ſecure; it that it is no matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of us here if we make ſure of heaven, that we looſe all even tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings by neglecting our Souls, and that if we be truly careful of them we shall looſe nothing not even worldly goods; if we do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly believe theſe things, how can we be careful, how can we be ſollicitous for any thing but Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>

                  <p>Do you rely upon your friends in the world? while you are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and in a capacity of obliging many, you will never want a great number of friends, but the moment you fall into diſgrace, the moment you are no longer capable of ſerving them, thoſe pretended friends all diſapear and apply thsmſelves onely to him that ſucceeds you: and tho you were never ſo much a ſlave to a great man, he thinks it a ſufficient reward for all your ſervices to ſend
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50233:157"/>ſome footman to enquire how you do when you are on your Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>

                  <p>Yet the world is ſome rimes very free of its praiſes, becauſe it ſees every body deſirous of them; but if we reflect a little we shall find that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50233:158"/>thoſe great marks of eſteem, thoſe extraordinary praiſes, are the very ſame words of courſe, which we uſe every day to thoſe whom we eſteem leaſt, have we not obſerv'd that they who are moſt lavish of their praiſes to a mans face, are the firſt that ſpeak ill of him when they are at Liberty to vent their thoughts.

They are forc'd to laugh when their hearts are ready to break: the whole world is nothing but outſide and grimace, and he paſſes for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man who can diſſemble his griefs beſt.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the deſire of Liberty that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily engages men in the world; but can men be in a greater ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; a more abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? not only in the army, but in buſineſs, in every profeſſion, we are continually ſubject to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours &amp; will of others.</p>
                  <p>Certainly a worldling is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſieſt man living, but it is his own fault; he may render his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles meritorious if he will; he need not ſuffer ſo much to be a great Saint, if he would but ſuffer for God; Yes my God! the greateſt part of Chriſtians would think thy yoak inſupportable, if they were

To what purpoſe do we confeſs our Sins if we are not ſorry for them and reſolv'd to Sin no more? As it is eaſy, ſo it is efficacious becauſe all the merits of the Son of God are apply'd to us by this Sacrament. But whence

Which is a clear proof that our contrition is not ſincere: are we ignorant that the want of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a grievous ſin? or if we do know it, and pretend to ſtrive to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50233:161"/>raiſe it in our Souls, it is much to be fear'd that the Confeſſions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are null for all that? becauſe the motive of this pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is often onely the fear of being guilty of Sacriledge, and hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it is that as ſoon as our Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is over, and we are no longer in danger of committing Sacriledge, we relapſe again into the ſame faults as if we had never confeſs'd them: A man of ſence who has ſeriouſly weigh'd the Reaſons on both ſides, is not eaſily perſuaded to change his deſign; and can we imagine that our frequent falls were preceded by a ſincere reſolution to ſin no more? had we no motives to make that reſolution?

                     <hi>How</hi> great is your Satisfaction O Religious Souls, if you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your ſelves without any reſerve to Chriſt, you muſt be very unhappy if you, be not content with ſo good a maſter. Every ſtep you make in weaning your hearts from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects that you may fix them more abſolutely on him, will be an addition to your happineſs. All you have to fear is leaſt ſome part of your joy should proceed from that natural peace &amp; tranquility which a Life undiſturb'd with cares
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50233:164"/>and noiſe affords; for then it would be a falſe joy: you muſt ſeek the Croſs, you muſt chooſe and love that Croſs which is moſt uneaſy to you, and moſt thwarts your incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; you may eaſily find ſuch a Croſs every Day in your convent, you will continually meet with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething that contradicts your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or diſpleaſes your fancy; you ought to be watchful to make good uſe of theſe precious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitys of renouncing your own jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and will in all things, without this ſubmiſſion your peace is imperfect, and will ſoon be at an end. 'Tis a ſolid happineſs to live in a Society where ſuch perfect Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſo much Virtue reigns; tho the truly fervent ſoul who ſeeks one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, would not be the worſe although there were leſs Piety in his Community, becauſe he is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with watching over and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his own faults that he has no leiſure to mind other mens: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing helps thoſe who have a good intention: the bad examples which corrupt the weak, are ſo
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50233:164"/>many incitements to increaſe his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to his Redeemer, that he may repair their negligence by his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and by an holy fear preſerve himſelfe from imitating them- Yet it is a great advantage to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with good examples, to have alwayes thoſe excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels before our eyes to ſtirr us up to diligence, and to make us a sham'd when we begin to languish. We shall alwayes find ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in numerous convents; but if we have not living examples, let us profit by the dead; to this end it will be very uſefull to read fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and carefully the Lives of thoſe of your order, who by the practiſe of the duty's of your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation arriv'd to an eminent degree of Sanctity: but here you muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve your ſuperior's leave for you had better do nothing than under take any thing without their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; if they give you leave, you should be careful to obſerve in your Reading, by what ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods thoſe holy Souls arriv'd through the Grace of Chriſt to ſuch
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50233:165"/>a degree of perfection; and you will find that having the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you may eaſyly practiſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of what they did. I have but one thing more to add, but it is very eſſential, and I pray God it may never be out of your thoughts, for I am ſure if you obſerve it, you will find the ſatisfaction of it all the reſt of your Life; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you enter'd into Religion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave your Souls, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the account you muſt give to God when he shall think fit to call you; this ought to be your onely care; you will be examined how you have kept your vows &amp; obſerv'd your Rule, be alwayes ready to anſwer. Let others live as they pleaſe, tis none of your buſineſs, it is a dangetous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to trouble your ſelves with others mens actions, it is enough for you to know what is requir'd of you, ro be perſuaded that what ever your Superious command whether you think it reaſonable or no, provided it be not ſinful is indeed the will of God; this is as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50233:165"/>certain as the preſence of Jefus-Chriſt in the holy Sacrament. For that very thing which you dislike is moſt infallibly in your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the means which God jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges moſt proper for your Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A ſuperior may governe ill, but it is moſt certain that God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns you well by his means, think ſeriouſly of this, for if you do not abſolutely lay down this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you looſe all your Time: A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life is nothing but Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: No obedience can be merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that is not render'd to God in the perſon of thoſe whom he has ſet in his place, and they who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, examine and condemn their orders, do not conſider God in them. If the ſpirit of God dwell in us he will give us the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a little Infant, who thinks every thing good and reaſonable, he will inſpire us with that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial prudence which ſees God in every thing, which finds him in all perſons, even in thoſe who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve leaſt virtues, and but few of the natural or ſupernatural qualitys
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50233:166"/>which repreſent him. The greater your parts are the more ſubmiſſive you ought to be, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reaſonable and more advantageous than to be govern'd by God, in what manner or by what perſon ſo ever he ſignify's his will; we can not begin too ſoon after our entrance into Religion, to love Poverty; we shall find an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction to be able to tell our Saviour, my Dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour! I have nothing but thee; I have no affection to any of thoſe things which I have leave to uſe; if I should find my heart inclin'd to any thing but thy ſelfe I would keep that thing no longer; My God! what a ſatisfaction is it to dye with a Crucifix before us, after having liv'd in conformity to a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Saviour?</p>

This Principle ſelf Love which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious in making advantage of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, employs to deceive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who make profeſſion of Piety, by perſuading them to draw conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from it very different from the true ſpirit of Chriſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>If</hi> any thing (ſays agreat ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God) could shake my faith in the Miſtery of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, it would not be a doubt of that infinite power which God exerts there: I should ſooner ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the exceeding Love of Jeſus in giuing himſelfe there to us; for I am not able to comprehend how men can believe that he is preſent on our Altars, and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in this adorable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, And yet be indifferent and cold to him, be forgetful of and diſguſted with him.</p>
                  <p>Who would not expect that ſuch a wonderful Prodigy of Love, should excite, at leaſt, a deſire, an earneſtneſs, and exceeding tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hearts of all men? But Alas! it is juſt contrary; We act as if we should have lov'd him more, if he had lov'd us leſs; I tremble, O my God! at the thought of the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50233:183"/>indignitys and outrages which the impiety of bad Chriſtians, and the fury of Hereticks have offer'd to thee in this Auguſt Sacrament; how Sacrilegiouſly have they profan'd thy Altars, and thy Churches? how impiouſly an'd ſcornfully have they often treated the Body of Chriſt? Can any Chriſtian call to mind the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe horrible impiety's without being earneſtly deſirous to repair by all poſſible means thoſe barbarous ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages? And how can a Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, and not have that deſire?</p>
                  <p>Have I often thought on this? Do I think often on it? I who appear ſo ſeldom at the foot of the Altar, and who am ſo unwilling to ſpare a little Time to adore my Saviour, a ſpecially at thoſe hours when the Churches are leaſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
                  <p>My God! I will think ſeriouſly on it for the future, becauſe I will now begin to love thee truly; and certainly it is high time for me to begin: I have made ſeveral reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to love thee and have broke them all, but I am confident this
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50233:183"/>will be effectuall; Yes my Divine Saviour, I am fully reſolv'd to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve thee, and to love thee without any reſerve: thou haſt loved me, and wouldſt have me love thee, and therefore I am ſure that thou wilt not refuſe me thy Grace to enable me to love thee; full of this hope and confidence I am bold to ſay with thy Holy Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Quis ergo nos ſeparabit à charitate Chriſti?
